<p>As everything good also the MAMI project comes to an end, or actually
 came to an end, as it is officially over since Dec 2018. Last week we 
also had our final review meeting and that now really means, it’s done! I
 guess that’s good and bad news.</p>



<p>The (b/s)ad news, first of all, is that this will be last post on

 our twitter account (@mamiproject) as we will keep you posted with 
interesting news about Internet evolution and the usual events (IETF 
meetings, research conferences, and there is another edition of the MNM 
workshop coming up co-located with <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/2019/">TMA’19</a> in Paris)!</p>



<p>The good news is that I think we can call the project a success. 
Looking back at the goals we were aiming for when we started the project
 three years ago, it’s not quite were we are now, but many good things 
have happened that we can call our achievement. The project was mainly 
focused on problems with protocol ossification on the Internet and 
subsequently arising limitations for protocol and service evolution. 
These problems are still there, and it was never the assumption that we 
could make them go away in (just) three years. However, we do understand
 the problem and potential solutions to it much better and many small 
steps have been taken. </p>



<p>Our initial proposal as a way forward was the introduction of a shim 
layer for path cooperation, where the layer boundary is also the 
encryption boundary to clearly separate path signaling from end-to-end 
information. Chances seemed promising to deploy our approach together 
with the introduction of a completely new transport protocol, QUIC, when
 we started the project but at the end it didn’t happen that way. Still 
the idea of a carefully designed <strong><em>wire image</em></strong> that provides explicit signals to the path has spread the word and is now defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-iab-wire-image/">standards</a> and applied by the <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/311830/spinbit-imc-authors-copy.pdf?sequence=8&amp;isAllowed=y">Spin Bit</a> in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/">QUIC</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="src/QUIC-mic-queue-1024x596.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-601" width="367" height="213"><figcaption>Discussion at IETF QUIC meeting about the Spin Bit.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>And then there are also a couple of lessons learnt, or let’s call it 
take-aways, that, I’m pretty sure of, not only the MAMI partners will 
further apply in their future research work and standardization efforts 
but that have also influenced the community as a whole in how we think 
about the Internet and protocol design. For example, the main take-away 
from the <a href="index.php/2018/10/22/the-mami-management-and-measurement-summit/index.html">M3S workshop</a>,
 that we held last year with a bunch of industry stakeholders, is that 
future in-network function need to be visible to the endpoints and will 
need consensus from both sides (also see the <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/m3s-london/m3s-white-paper.pdf">M3S report</a>).
 That doesn’t sound like a groundbreaking insight, however, it is a 
change in how we designed and operated the Internet so far, as without 
the wide-spread deployment of encryption or at least (integrity) 
protection, the easiest and cheapest way has often not followed this 
principle.</p>



<p>Another effort by the MAMI project, that has impacted the way we 
design and discuss protocols, is our measurement work. Our approach here
 was always to base design decisions on measured evidence. The challenge
 here is not only to measure the right thing at the right point of time 
but to also to collect enough measurement data in order to draw a 
signification conclusion whether an observed impairment will be barrier 
for deployment or not. Good engineering decisions require not only 
information about the types of impairments that can arise, but estimates
 of the risk of encountering them on any particular type of network. 
Over the last three year we have performed a whole bunch of measurement 
studies, many of them with our own tool for path transparency 
measurements <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a> that will further be used and maintained by an ex-MAMIan who is now working with the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR project</a>. We published our findings as papers, in blog posts, or presented them directly at standardization events (see e.g. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/maprg/meetings/">IRTF maprg</a>) and other industry meetings. And our results on e.g. <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/2018/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/tma2018_paper12.pdf">ECN</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/slides-99-tsvwg-sessb-31measurements-concerning-the-dscp-for-a-le-phb-00">DSCP</a>, <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/2018/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/tma2018_paper57.pdf">PMTU</a>, or <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-a-tale-of-two-checksums-tom-jones">IP checksum calculation</a> have impacted and are still impacting work in the IETF tsvwg (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud/">this</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tsvwg-le-phb/">this</a>, and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fairhurst-udp-options-cco/">this</a>) and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tcpm-generalized-ecn/">tcpm</a> as well as operations directly (see <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/increasing-ipv6-mtu/">cloudefare blog</a>).</p>



<p>However, doing measurements is hard work and costs time and money. 
Therefore we always had this vision of utilizing the measurement data as
 a whole that we have collected as a community over so many years. This 
idea has driven the work on our own repository system, called the <a href="https://observatory.mami-project.eu/">Path Transparency Observatory (PTO)</a>,
 as well as the commitment of some of the MAMI partners to support and 
drive efforts to increase repeatability and reproduciblility of 
measurement results or actually research results in general in the CS 
networking community (see <a href="http://vaibhavbajpai.com/documents/papers/proceedings/reproducibility-sigcomm-workshop-2017.pdf">here</a>, <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=18412">here</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/hyperpaper/ccr-ednote/raw/master/cccp.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p>So while we will all not work together as a project anymore (and 
distribute nice stickers and M&amp;Ms), you can see that the work of the
 project will not stop with end of the project funding. I think I can 
well speak for everybody in the project and say that we really enjoyed 
working together and are at least a little proud of what we have 
achieved in the last three years. Thanks for everybody who has worked on
 the project, as well as our “MAMI friends” who have not only joint us 
for many fun dinners and lunches (e.g. see draft beer tour in Berlin) 
but also collaboratively worked with us (see <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-taps-post-sockets/">post socket</a>/<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/taps/documents/">taps</a>) or provided good and valuable advise (e.g. the <a href="index.php/about-mami/external-advisory-board/index.html">EAB</a>)!
 Other than that, all that’s left to say is: keep enjoying our stickers 
if you still have some and see you soon no matter what!</p>

				<p>If you’ve followed the MAMI project over the past three years, 
you know that we are big fans of Explicit Congestion Notification (<a href="index.php/2016/06/13/70-of-popular-web-sites-support-ecn/index.html">ECN</a>).
 First, it provides an illustrative case study of the deployment of an 
optional transport protocol feature: standardized in 2001, deployment 
lagged for a decade due to reports of its signaling crashing certain 
routers, and rolled out slowly on the server side due to defaults in the
 Linux kernel, until deployment accelerated due to client-side defaults 
in Mac OS X. Second, manipulation of ECN is <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2017/anrw17-final16.pdf">indicative</a> of other TCP and IP manipulations, especially of DSCP.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the evolution of ECN support and problems with ECN in the MAMI <a href="https://observatory.mami-project.eu/">Path Transparency Observatory</a>
 front-end. The front page shows a matrix, from which we can see that we
 have ECN measurements back to 2014 (including measurements taken before
 the project, and before the development of <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a>):</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-849" src="src/pto-matrix-300x279.png" alt=""  width="300" height="279"> The <a href="https://observatory.mami-project.eu//static/charts.html?page=ecn">charts page</a> for ECN has charts for raw observations of ECN-dependent connectivity failure (<code>ecn.connectivity</code> conditions), as well as charts of ECN negotiation. Let’s look at connectivity first:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-850" src="src/ecn-connectivity-green-1024x500.png" alt="" width="640" height="313"></p>
<p>The top chart shows the proportion of observations we have of each 
condition, and the bottom chart shows the absolute number of 
measurements. Green (<code>ecn.connectivity.works</code>) is good: indeed, attempting to ECN does not often cause problems with connectivity<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>.
 By clicking on the conditions above the chart, we can disable the 
display of certain states; by doing this for all conditions except <code>ecn.connectivity.broken</code> (i.e., attempts to negotiate ECN cause connectivity failure), we can see the following clear downward trend:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-851" src="src/ecn-connectivity-red-1024x502.png" alt="" width="640" height="314"></p>
<p>Clicking on one of these bars brings up a detail view of the 
observations from which it is derived (If the observation query for that
 bar has not already been cached, you may have to wait). To learn more 
about each target, clicking on the IP address will pull up the <a href="https://stat.ripe.net/">RIPEstat</a> page for that address.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-852" src="src/ecn-connectivity-obs-300x210.png" alt="" width="300" height="210"></p>
<p>For many measurements, we have data taken from multiple vantage 
points toward the same targets, in order to attempt to find “on-path” 
(as opposed to “near-server”) interference with ECN; these are 
represented in <code>ecn.multipoint</code> conditions:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-853" src="src/multipoint-negotiation-1024x444.png" alt="" width="640" height="278"></p>
<p>Here we see another unsurprising up-and-to-the-right trend: due in 
large part to the dominance of Linux web servers and reasonable 
practices on upgrading them, of about 800000 measurements we took from 
three vantage points (in Toronto, Amsterdam, and Singapore) this week, 
more than 86% support ECN negotiation. By zooming in on on <code>ecn.multipoint.negotiation.path_dependent</code> conditions, we can see that there are still a few servers accessible via paths with TCP header manipulation deployed:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-854" src="src/multipoint-path-dependent-1024x442.png" alt="" width="640" height="276"></p>
<p>We invite you to explore the PTO. To learn more about the PTO itself, have a look at our <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/D12.pdf">Deliverable 1.2,</a>
 which details its design. All of the software behind the PTO is 
available open source: the core PTO server and tools for running 
normalization and analysis are in the <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pto3-go">pto3-go</a> repository, and the web front-end in <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pto3-web">pto3-web</a>.

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>On the 5th December 2018 we kicked off a two-day hackathon with participants from MAMI and the <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a> at the University of Aberdeen. The goal of the hackathon was to share experiences in Internet measurement between our projects.</p>
<p></p><center><img src="src/mamiooni-300x120.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-822" width="300" height="120"></center><p></p>
<p>We started with presentations from the participants to get everyone 
up to speed on what each other had been working on. Iain Learmonth 
presented <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a>, Simone Basso presented <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/install/ooniprobe/">ooniprobe</a> and Raffaele Zullo presented <a href="http://www.middleboxes.org/tracemore/">tracemore</a>.</p>
<p>While the MAMI measurements have had an Internet engineering focus 
attempting to find broken behavior in the Internet, OONI measurements 
focus on finding censorship in the Internet. Typically both broken 
behavior and censorship can be found implemented in middleboxes and so 
there is overlap between these areas of interest.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2017/anrw17-final16.pdf"><em>Tracking transport-layer evolution with PATHspider</em></a>,
 we identified with PATHspider that protocol-dependent connectivity 
failures can be correlated with networks that have large-scale 
censorship infrastructure. This is probably not deliberate, but a side 
effect of misconfiguration or poorly written software running on these 
boxes. To allow for OONI to leverage this discovery, three of the 
PATHspider tests for discovering broken middleboxes have been added to 
the <a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec">OONI test specifications</a> repository.</p>
<p>The tests we have added are for protocol-dependent connectivity failure of: <a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/techniques/tq-031-attempt-ecn.md">ECN</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/techniques/tq-033-attempt-tfo.md">TCP Fast Open</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ooni/spec/blob/master/techniques/tq-032-attempt-h2-upgrade.md">H2</a>. Support for executing these tests in <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit">measurement-kit</a>, the measurement library developed for use in ooniprobe, has already been added for <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/mkcurl/commit/a5c258b5ecd30692d988cea281487e0daff47600">TCP Fast Open</a> and <a href="https://github.com/measurement-kit/mkcurl/commit/dea2a85fd535192b1cf35af164c97c9eff202de4">H2</a>.</p>
<p>Ana Custura added <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pathspider/commit/b6a578ac5c96b9f198378f04c10c742074d5cc34">support for using arbitrary socket options</a> for DNS-based plugins in PATHspider that will enable new measurements that previously could only be performed with TCP.</p>
<p>One issue with PATHspider is that many of the tests require 
privileged access to the device, while OONI would like to have 
volunteers run measurements from their Android devices without requiring
 “rooting” or other techniques. We explored whether the ability to <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/625224/">add eBPF programs to sockets</a>
 used for measurements might be a substitute for privileged access and 
our initial thought experiments looked promising, however we did not 
have time to implement any experiments.</p>
<p>The MAMI project would like to thank <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor Project</a> for partially supporting the costs for this event.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>As you may have read in our last post, the MAMI project is 
celebrating the hard-won, long-discussed consensus to add a spin bit to 
QUIC. The spin bit was conceived as the minimum useful explicit signal 
one could add to a transport protocol, and we think the benefit for the 
overhead is quite worth it. Though it exposes “just” RTT, latency 
(together with data rate, which is available in QUIC simply by counting 
packets and bytes on the wire) is possibly the most important metric for
 understanding transport layer performance diagnosing all matter of 
transport-relevant network problems, and the spin signal itself can also
 be observed to infer loss and other issues with network treatment of a 
packet stream. The definition and deployment of the spin bit is 
therefore a victory for <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.02902v1.pdf">making network protocols more measurable</a> while preserving the privacy gains from encryption, and a victory for network operations and management.</p>
<p>When we started the MAMI project, we had a much more extensive vision for middlebox cooperation: our <a href="https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/CNSM_2017.pdf">Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS) proposal</a>
 provides a generalized signaling mechanism allowing signals from the 
sender to the path element, as well as a mechanism for allowing on-path 
elements to communicate information to the receiver (and back to the 
sender with the receiver’s assistance) in a safe, limited way, all with 
end-to-end integrity protection. However, we failed to achieve consensus
 to move forward in the IETF with this proposal by forming a working 
group, so we refocused our efforts on a more modest implementation of 
the explicit signaling concept.</p>
<p>Selective exposure, however, has a pretty toxic reputation in the 
IETF, as it “breaks” TLS, by adding a third-party to a two-party 
protocol and changing its security properties, reducing or eliminating 
integrity and confidentiality protection with respect to a set of 
entities in the network that may or may not be known to one or both 
endpoints. In our <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/m3s-london/m3s-white-paper.pdf">recently published white paper</a>, the outcome of the <a href="index.php/2018/10/22/the-mami-management-and-measurement-summit/index.html">M3S meeting</a>, we argued that all approaches in this space must provide transparency and control to the endpoints.</p>
<p>In hindsight, more important to the controversy around PLUS was (in 
our opinion) a fundamental misunderstanding about what is meant by the 
term “middlebox cooperation”, as there are two broad approaches to 
supporting on-path operations on encrypted traffic being pursued in the 
industry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explicit signaling approaches like PLUS, where information about 
encrypted traffic is carried separately from the encrypted traffic 
itself.</li>
<li>Selective exposure approaches like mcTLS, mbTLS, eTLS and so on, 
which share secrets from the end-to-end cryptographic context with 
middleboxes, allowing them to decrypt (and in some cases, modify) 
traffic between the endpoints.</li>
</ul>
<p>We focused on explicit signaling in MAMI, in part due to the 
difficulty of building selective exposure approaches that still provide 
useful security properties for the end-to-end communication. However, 
large parts of industry are more interested in selective exposure, 
because building and deploying selective exposure approaches promises to
 be more easily backward-compatible with existing protocols and network 
hardware. PLUS, after all, envisioned deploying a new transport protocol
 stack. We examine the tradeoffs in these approaches in <a href="wp-content/uploads/2018/12/white-paper.pdf">another white paper</a>, released today.</p>
<p>Among the arguments presented against PLUS at our BoF in Berlin in 
July 2016 were doubts that the protocol was safe in general: that it 
provided new side-channels for data exfiltration or hooks for coercion. 
We looked into this as part of our own internal study of 
integrity-protected, encrypted-payload middlebox cooperation approaches 
like PLUS, finding in a <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/raw/master/security-white-paper/mcp-security-white-paper.pdf">white paper</a>, also released today, that the additional attack surface presented by PLUS is negligible.</p>
<p>The looming end of the project does not mean the end of the problems 
we set out to solve, or interest among the project participants and the 
field in general in improving privacy and evolvability through 
encryption while retaining limited support for in network functions. So,
 we ask ourselves: <em><strong>what’s next?</strong></em></p>
<p>Several threads of work in this space will outlive MAMI:</p>
<p>Our efforts to add measurability to QUIC, which appears to represent 
the first real hope of deployable transport evolution in the last three 
decades, will of course continue. And QUIC itself will continue to 
evolve. The group of implementors and network folks we’ve helped pull 
together around the spin bit will keep experimenting with the best ways 
to make it possible to do passive measurement and diagnosis, as QUIC 
traffic increasingly supplants TCP.</p>
<p>Our work on experimentation with the Loss/Latency Tradeoff (LoLa) 
signal continues, as we noted in the previous blog bost. LoLa may enable
 better performance for real-time communications traffic and was first 
specified as a bit in the PLUS header continues, with a possible 
implementation as a DSCP codepoint.</p>
<p>The IRTF Path Aware Networking Research Group (PANRG), founded by the project, is pursuing work both in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-panrg-what-not-to-do/">understanding why</a> previous attempts to consider middleboxes in transport layer interactions have failed, and in<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-enghardt-panrg-path-properties/"> exploring a set of properties</a> of end-to-end paths on which future explicit signaling methods could be built.</p>
<p>Further, there is ongoing work on UDP options in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tsvwg/documents/">IETF TSVWG</a>
 and a discussion about support for proxying of UDP-based, encrypted 
protocol started in the at IETF-103 with some initial presentations 
about <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvarea-feature-requests-for-advanced-udp-proxying-katharine-daly-00">requirements</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvarea-proxying-encrypted-transports-thomas-fossati-00">use cases</a> in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/agenda-103-tsvarea-02">tsvarea session</a>.</p>
<p>We are very happy that this important discussion is continued and 
that we as a project could provide a valuable input based on measurement
 and experimentation. And while the project’s time had to come to an end
 at some point, the MAMI contributors will keep working on this in order
 to keep the Internet operational as well as improve&nbsp; its 
robustness in operation, performance, and security.</p>

				<p>The MAMI project was back at the IETF for the last time — as a 
project, anyway — last month at IETF 103 in Bangkok. Join us on a trip 
through the week!</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_807" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-807 size-medium" src="src/IMG_7192-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"><p class="wp-caption-text">the IETF 103 venue in Bangkok</p></div><p></p>
<h2>Hackathon: Loss-Latency Tradeoff in Mobile Networks</h2>
<p>Most of us arrived on the Friday before the meeting in order to 
attend the now already traditional hackathon. This time we set up a 
table to pull together a few different projects related to measurement 
and measurability. Friends of the project Fabio Gulgarella and Mauro 
Cociglio ran an experiment running on a 2-bit variant of the spin-bit 
they dubbed “delay sample”. Thomas Fossati, as main representative of 
the MAMI project, has been doing some measurements on the impact of the 
LoLa bit on the mobile network.</p>
<p>This is another instance of the “one-bit signalling” topic we’ve been
 working on in MAMI – notably, a Loss/Latency Tradeoff (LoLa) bit was 
present in the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-trammell-plus-spec-01.txt">original PLUS proposal</a>.
 These experiments are concerned with mapping the LoLa signal to a 
dedicated low-latency bearer in the LTE core and air interface. This is 
different from how mobile networks are deployed today, to actively 
ignoring <a href="http://dl.ifip.org/db/conf/tma/tma2017/mnm2017_paper13.pdf">or bleaching</a>
 any end-user signal, and bundling all flows to and from the Internet 
into a single “default” bearer, whose buffering characteristics that are
 not compatible with low-latency traffic. The established behaviour is 
partly rooted in the desire to prioritise operators’ voice services over
 competing over-the-top services, but that market consideration has lost
 relevance in the recent years.</p>
<p>It looks like the incentives are now aligned in the direction of 
allowing more suitable treatment of Internet real-time flows. However, a
 couple of preconditions need to be satisfied before we can move on from
 the status quo. First, the real-time flows must be efficiently 
identified so that they can be put on the right queue especially nearby 
the bottleneck link, which in 4G mobile networks is typically the air 
interface. This is at odds with the rise of encrypted and multiplexed 
transports, which has the potential of increasing the cost/accuracy 
ratio of DPI over the acceptable threshold. LoLa instead is this simple 
clear-text signal set by the endpoints which would enable a super 
efficient classifier. The question is how can we trust the endpoints to 
set the LoLa signal correctly? What if they lie? Would they get an 
advantage at the expenses of other flows? The hackathon experiments were
 aimed at answering these core questions. On one hand we wanted to see 
whether giving mobile devices a low-latency bearer in addition to the 
default one would make a difference in terms of QoE. And secondly, we 
wanted to measure what happens when an endpoint lies about the nature of
 its flows. So Thomas spent his Saturday and Sunday hacking around the 
LTE module of NS-3 and getting these <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/ietf-103-lola/hotrfc/build/main.pdf">fine results</a>
 which he also presented at the HotRFC session on Sunday night. We got 
some positive feedback about the idea from a few mobile operators in the
 room.&nbsp; Thomas, Gorry Fairhurst and Mirja Kühlewind together with 
Vz, AT&amp;T, Orange and Three managed to schedule a side meeting for 
later in the week to discuss both the finer points and an overall 
coordination strategy also involving and the 3GPP liaison Georg Mayer 
and Florin.</p>
<h2>Hackathon: Path MTU Signaling in QUIC</h2>
<p>In addition, Tom Jones worked on Path MTU signaling mechanisms for QUIC at the QUIC hackathon table. Tom’s draft describing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tsvwg-datagram-plpmtud">“Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery for Datagram Transports”</a>
 will also be incorporated in QUIC. MTU discovery is also under 
discussion in the 6MAN Working Group, where there are two competing 
proposals to add new mechanisms that allow better signalling of MTU by 
routers a long the path, Truncate and Hop By Hop:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Truncate proposal adds a MTU Destination Option, the intention 
of this option is that when a router has to discard a packet for being 
too large it also truncates the datagram. The MTU Destination Option 
carries the original packet length allowing the end host to detect this 
packet as ‘truncated’, and the end host uses this packet to send an ICMP
 PTB message.</li>
<li>The Hop By Hop proposal creates a new IPv6 Hop By Hop option. This 
option is added to small packets, when a router forwards a packet with 
this option it examines the MTU field in the option, if the MTU is 
larger than the routers out going link it updates the MTU field to match
 this link size.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tom implemented the HBH proposal at the IETF 103 Hackathon to get a 
sense of how practical it was to add to a real network stack — he had 
previously implemented the Truncate proposal on the flight back from 
IETF102 in Montreal. His inplementation in FreeBSD achieved self-interop
 between end host and router in the two days. Running code is a core 
part of the IETF ethos, after IETF 103 we are able to compare how the 
HBH and Truncate proposals compare and differ in implementation.</p>
<h2>Monday: Evolving Transport</h2>
<p>On Monday, the official sessions started with an interesting 
discussion about the evolution of transport and the role of proxies in 
the Transport area open meeting featured with presentations from Lucas 
Pardue and Ben Schwartz’s team on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvarea-quic-addendums-lucas-pardue-00">HiNT</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvarea-feature-requests-for-advanced-udp-proxying-katharine-daly-00">Helium</a>&nbsp;and a presentation from Thomas on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvarea-proxying-encrypted-transports-thomas-fossati-00">PEPs role and fate</a>
 in an end-to-end encrypted Internet. One of the takeaways of the 
session is that if we want to keep PEPs alive, which looks like a 
sensible thing to do at least in some scenarios (cfr. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-quic-and-satcom-nicolas-kuhn">satellite</a>), we need to re-think the security model in particular how the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kuehlewind-crypto-sep-00.txt">transport security association is modelled</a>
 and what is its relationship with the security context that sits at the
 application layer. QUIC in particular, collapses the two into a single 
inextricable blob, making proxying an all-or-nothing option, which is 
far from ideal. The “transport proxy” gang (including us, Lucas and 
Ben’s team) is going to chat further again in December to discuss next 
steps.</p>
<p>Then the first TSVWG session on Monday touched a little on the PMTUD 
work happening in other working groups, as already mentioned above. And 
we had a presentation by friend-of-the-project Colin Perkins on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvwg-sessb-31-impact-of-transport-header-encryption-00">Transport Header Encryption Draft</a>,
 recently adopted by the WG, which explores transport-specific 
considerations of the trend toward more ubiquitous encryption and 
encryption deeper down the stack.</p>
<h2>Tuesday: Measurement and Analysis for Protocols and the MAMI Lunch</h2>
<p>The founded-by-MAMI Measurement and Analaysis for Protocols Research 
Group (MAPRG) met on Tuesday. This time we had an 2-hour slot (slightly 
shorter than usually) with interesting talk about <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-a-tale-of-two-checksums-tom-jones">UDP checksum issues</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-quic-and-satcom-nicolas-kuhn">QUIC performance over&nbsp; satellite</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-evaluating-the-performance-of-coap-mqtt-and-http-in-vehicular-scenarios-jaime-jimenez">comparison of CoAP/MQTT/HTTP in vehicular scenarios</a>, as well as measurements on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-the-rise-of-certificate-transparency-and-its-implications-on-the-internet-ecosystem-matthias-wahlisch">Certificate Transparency</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-maprg-is-the-web-ready-for-ocsp-must-staple-nick-sullivan">OCSP Must Staple deployment</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday also saw our traditional lunch for MAMI and friends:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-806 size-large" src="src/IMG_0137-e1544006429835.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="480"></a></p>
<h2>Tuesday and Wednesday: QUIC and the Spin Bit</h2>
<p>Since MAMI is largely focused on transport evolution, and transport 
evolution work in the IETF is now focused on the completion and 
deployment of the IETF standard version of QUIC, the “main event” of the
 IETF for the project was the QUIC working group. QUIC met on Tuesday 
and Wednesday. Tuesday’s meeting covered smaller issues, including the <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-applicability">applicability</a> and <a href="http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-manageability">manageability</a> drafts, presented by Mirja.</p>
<p>After 18 months of heated discussion and thorough experimentation, the latency <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2018/05/11/explicit-passive-measurability-and-the-quic-spin-bit/">spin bit</a>
 was&nbsp; been accepted during the second session on Wednesday as a 
feature of the base QUIC protocol. Implementation and participation in 
signaling are optional, though several large endpoint implementors 
indicated they will implement and enable the bit by default. The 
consensus is to add just the spin bit, without the Valid Edge counter 
described in our recent <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/311830/spinbit-imc-authors-copy.pdf">IMC paper</a>.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_812" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-812 size-large" src="src/DrXflNFU4AAuoAl.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="427"><p class="wp-caption-text">QUIC hums on the Spin Bit (image: <a href="https://twitter.com/csperkins">@csperkins</a>)</p></div><p></p>
<p>This proposal has been pretty controversial, not so much technically 
but rather from a political perspective – being a proxy for the wider 
(and highly flammable) discussion around the tension between protocol 
encryption and network functions in the IETF. One key takeaway of this 
whole experience (and a key result of the MAMI project as a whole) is 
that getting the right balance between opaqueness and transparency a 
protocol’s wire image should provide is a very tough job and requires a 
great deal of analysis and experimentation along many different axes.</p>
<p>After three years working on these topics, and despite the 
hyper-sensitivity to privacy issues in the Internet many of us in the 
project have, we are even more then ever convinced that a world of 
completely opaque wires is not a place where we would like to spend our 
future, and that total privacy and total privatisation of the Internet 
infrastructure are two sides of the same coin. The Internet is a common 
good and we need to keep it that way, finding the right balance between 
what is visible and what is not is a tough job but we need to resist the
 temptation to use the encryption hammer for things that are not 
necessarily privacy related – e.g., as anti-ossification techniques. We 
very much hope that this decision enables now more experimentation and 
will lead to more experience with these kind of explicit signals which 
can be the basis for more discussion about additional features that 
would support measurability.</p>
<h2>Wednesday: UDP Options, MARC, and Encrypted SNI</h2>
<p>Wednesday morning also saw the second TSVWG Working Group session discussing the status of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/103/materials/slides-103-tsvwg-sessa-51-cco-and-implementation-status-for-udp-options-02">UDP Options</a>,
 with Tom presenting an implementation report. Tom also followed up on 
questions asked on the TSVWG mailing list about the future and 
suitability of <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tsvwg/83z8i3gGFaVETaihkwheMYsdCmc">FRAG, LITE and AE UDP Options.</a>
 This led to an enthusiastic discussion about the suitability and use of
 UDP Options at all. Tom continued with another presentation, this time 
on Datagram PLPMTUD, this slot was grouped with presentations from the 
authors of the 6MAN drafts attempting to address PTMUD. These 
presentations led to very productive working group discussion on both 
PLPMTUD and PMTUD, with finding the right MTU for a network still being 
an open problem.</p>
<p>The video interest group (GGIE) side meeting we presented MARC 
(mobile assisted rate controller), the congestion controller developed 
by Morteza and Gorry in the project that uses (among others) the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-flinck-mobile-throughput-guidance-04.txt">mobile throughput guidance</a>
 signal from the eNodeB to adapt the sending rate to the (very quickly 
and widely) changing conditions of the mobile network. There was an 
entertaining discussion around the topic including a nice digression on 
how to carry the MTG signal in QUIC using UDP options.</p>
<p>In TLS there was more discussion about the encrypted SNI proposal 
which is trying to remove one privacy-critical bit of clear-text from 
the TLS wire image. Of course SNI is relevant to policing middleboxes 
(enterprise TLS proxies, censorship and parental control filters), hence
 some of the usual scuffle. There are a couple of issues with the 
current ESNI proposal, one of which is pretty substantial in terms of 
the ability to reliably deploy the feature, but there is a huge amount 
of energy being poured into finding a good solution so hopefully we are 
going to get something done soon-ish. On another topic, the DTLS 1.3 
protocol specification is complete and ready for review by the working 
group. We need some security analysis there which will take a fair 
amount of cycles. In the meantime, the DTLS 1.2 connection identifier is
 done and is currently in working group last call. So this should 
provide an OK solution (although not ideal because of the higher 
correlation properties compared to 1.3) until 1.3 is finalised and 
deployed at scale.</p>
<h2>Wednesday: Transport Services (TAPS)</h2>
<p>The Transport Services (TAPS) working group, in which MAMI heavily 
contributes, continues its work to standardize an interface to a modern 
Internet transport layer. The group had a productive session, solving 
some of the <a href="https://github.com/taps-api/drafts/issues">open issues</a> for the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-taps-interface/">API document</a>.
 In addition Tommy Pauly, another friend of the project, presented a 
mapping of the TAPS interface to QUIC, leading to a discussion about 
mappings for different DNS variants (DoT, DoH, … Do*) as a quite 
interesting use case for taps, given it could actually provide an 
opportunity to simplify future mappings of DNS to other transports.</p>
<p>If you’d like to help the TAPS effort as well, it’s now the right time to review the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-taps-arch">architecture document</a> as the first of the taps trilogy, to be published around IETF 104 in March 2019.</p>
<h2>Thursday: ACME, Round Tables, and Not-So-Secret Cabals</h2>
<p>The very last session of the meeting was ACME. MAMI has a couple of drafts there: the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-star/">STAR</a>
 document, which is going through a second LC as we speak due to some 
adjustments we had to do related to a pretty big last minute change in 
the base ACME spec, and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sheffer-acme-star-delegation/">delegation</a>
 draft, which we have re-written as an ACME profile (as per request in 
Montreal) which – good news everyone! – we got consensus to adopt by the
 working group. As per IETF process, the official CfA confirmation is 
currently on the mailing list and should be over in a few days.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the long-running Post Sockets Secret Cabal met, though 
now this meeting is less an insurgency bent on overthrowing BSD Sockets 
and more merely an afterparty for the TAPS meeting where we distribute 
issues to work on before the next interim.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_811" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-811" src="src/DrePKOLUwAAIvFo-1024x407.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="254"><p class="wp-caption-text">The Post Sockets Not So Secret Cabal (image: <a href="https://twitter.com/csperkins">@csperkins</a>)</p></div><p></p>
<p>Thursday also saw our LoLa round table. The meeting went well and it 
was decided that the coordination for the various activities – which are
 likely to span more than one SDO – should happen in the Internet Group 
in GSMA. The activity is in progress, and last week I presented the plan
 at the GSMA IG plenary.</p>
<p>After that we had a de-brief with the spin-bit folks, including Brian
 joining remotely via Thomas’ laptop :-), to plan the next steps in 
measurement experimentation on QUIC. This was a fitting end to the 
technical part of the meeting in Bangkok, as well as the MAMI project’s 
official engagement in the IETF.&nbsp; For us, the IETF crowd of the 
project, it definitely has been an incredible pleasure working in MAMI 
and progress these important topics in standardization. MAMI has been a 
fantastic project, which tackled a core technical and societal tussle 
with an abundance of courage (and/or recklessness, you choose), with a 
truly amazing group of people! Thanks everybody!</p>

				<p>Just before <a href="index.php/2018/04/20/ietf101-in-london-march-17-23/index.html">IETF 101</a> in London in March, the MAMI project hosted an invitation-only <a href="index.php/events/mami-management-and-measurement-summit-m3s/index.html">MAMI Management and Measurement Summit (M3S)</a>,
 bringing together researchers, engineers, and vendors for a focused 
discussion on how to meet the challenges posed to network measurement 
and network management by the increasing deployment of strong encryption
 and the extension of encryption down the stack. Today, we release <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/m3s-london/m3s-white-paper.pdf">“Challenges in Network Management of Encrypted Traffic”</a>, a white paper covering the discussions and distilling the recommendations that came out of the meeting.</p>
<p>This discussion has played out in multiple forums, including the 
IETF, for some time, underpinning discussions and debates from the 
(failed) proposal to include static keys in TLS, to continue to provide 
for “business as usual” monitoring, to the <a href="https://blog.apnic.net/2018/05/11/explicit-passive-measurability-and-the-quic-spin-bit/">spin bit</a>
 proposal in QUIC, which replaces implicit passive measurability of RTT 
with an explicit signal. Recognizing that neither business as usual, nor
 forging forward with the deployment of strong crypto down the stack and
 invalidating most of the current practice of network management, are 
tenable positions, the attendees converged on a set of recommendations 
for future protocol design and network architecture to partially meet 
these challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>Protocols and networks must provide for <em><strong>independent measurability</strong></em>
 of important metrics when these measurements may be contested: one 
outcome of increasing encryption is that existing independent passive 
measurement techniques will become less effective.</li>
<li>Future secure protocols should support <em><strong>different security associations at different layers</strong></em>:
 approaches that integrate transport and application-layer security 
(such as QUIC) make limited or no provision for network management that 
need to interact with the transport protocol while not breaking 
application layer security, in contrast to the TLS-over-TCP status quo.</li>
<li>Transparent middleboxes should be replaced with <em><strong>middlebox transparency</strong></em>:
 the dominant architectural pattern for in-network functions today is 
that of the “transparent middlebox”, which attempts to the extent 
possible to be undetectable to the endpoint(s). While this has benefits 
for initial deployment, it makes it impossible to build cooperative 
protocols, where the middlebox and its functions are visible to the 
endpoints, and the endpoints have some control over how their traffic is
 treated by the network (in the last instance by detecting a middlebox 
with which they do not wish to cooperate, and cease using the path).</li>
</ol>

				<p>The IETF week started on Saturday with the hackthon. Diego, Pedro
 and I (Thomas) have been working on a variety of topics: a “STAR 
Requests” slide deck for the upcoming SecDispatch meeting, an 
architecture design for an end-to-end ACME STAR demo, and the one-bit 
experiment harness- reproducing and analysing a <a href="https://github.com/esnet/iperf/issues/768">bug</a> in iperf3 which prevents our trafic to produce reliable / precise emulation of a throughput-seeking flow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This was pretty quickly done and we got eventually <em>absorbed</em> by the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/suit/about/">SUIT</a> / <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/teep/about/">TEEP</a> table.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The back-story for this is I had brought from Cambridge to Montreal 40 boards with me, done <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DiEj6fqX0AIsYeA.jpg">especially</a>
 for the hackathon by ARM – Cambridge is a very small city where 
everyone seems to know everyone else. Though we didn’t get to do much 
with the boards and the TEEP protocol, we got to know a bit better the 
technology, talk to people involved and, in my case, share my experience
 with fellow Nokians IoT folks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
 QUIC spin-bit table, with Marcus, Al, Roni and Emile was also active on
 experimenting with 1-bit spin signal and a bunch of heuristics to 
reject bad RTT samples in presence of reordering. See Marcus

<p>On Monday, at the SecDispatch session Diego spoke about “<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-secdispatch-generating-certificate-requests-for-star-certificates-draft-sheffer-acme-star-request-02-00">Generating Certificate Requests for STAR Certificates</a>“.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This complements&nbsp;<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-star-03">ACME STAR</a>&nbsp;and
 is a building block needed for closing the loop in the identity-owner 
controlled name delegation workflow using X.509 certs we designed in 
MAMI. &nbsp;We need to find a sensible home for this document so that it
 can receive a thorough security analysis. The outcome of the discussion
 was quite surprising but, IMO, pretty good – even though there is a 
fair amount of running code that I’m going to trash as a result.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Martin
 and Ted noted that STAR request could be re-written in terms of pure 
ACME, provided the proof of the identifier ownership is not requested by
 the IdO.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>So, the 
subsequent step was to go back to ACME and discuss adoption of a STAR 
Request there, which is what we’ve done on Tuesday (see below). 
&nbsp;Earlier that day, at the TLS session, we discussed DTLS connection
 ID for 1.2 and 1.3, handling an interesting fallout from the recent 
major header refactoring in DTLS 1.3 on to the content type allocation 
(and its repercussions on the marking strategy envisaged for CID in 
1.2.).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The discussion is not settled yet, and continues on GitHub [<a href="https://github.com/tlswg/dtls13-spec/issues/56">1</a>], [<a href="https://github.com/tlswg/dtls13-spec/pull/58">2</a>], [<a href="https://github.com/tlswg/dtls-conn-id/issues/11">3</a>].</p>
<p>On Tuesday in ACME, STAR officially entered WGLC, which means, finger crossed, we should be pretty close to finalising this one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In
 relation to STAR Requests, instead, we were asked to produce a new 
version of the protocol as an ACME profile, which can then be called for
 adoption by the WG. &nbsp;So here <a href="https://github.com/thomas-fossati/I-D/blob/acme-delegation-profile/STAR-Request/draft-sheffer-acme-star-delegation.md">it is</a>, waiting for the base ACME draft to do the final adjustments to make it through IESG.</p>
<p>At the same time, in HTTPbis,&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-dispatch-helium-01">HELIUM</a> &amp; <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pardue-httpbis-http-network-tunnelling/">HiNT</a>&nbsp;were introduced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>This
 work lead by Google and BBC R&amp;D has some interesting overlap with 
MAMI in that it provides a tunnelling protocol and side channel with a 
proxy which might end up being useful in tuning CC for mobile networks 
in presence of fully encrypted end-to-end traffic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>I especially liked the alternative tagline “a proxy is an honest middlebox” in Ben’s presentation.</p>
<p>Discussion in taps, later that afternoon, many focused on the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-trammell-taps-interface-00">API draft</a>. While there are still a whole bunch of <a href="https://github.com/taps-api/drafts/issues">open issues</a>,
 thers broad agreement on the general concepts and a lively discussion 
making good progress to resolve these issues. The taps working group 
will hold a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/interim-2018-taps-02/session/taps">vitual interim on September 12</a>.</p>
<p>QUIC met on Wednesday morning. Work is winding up on the IETF 
standard version of this new transport protocol, which means it’s time 
to start talking about how it will interact with the rest of the 
Internet. Brian <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-quic-ops-drafts-00">presented</a>
 the “operations” drafts for the first time, though they’ve been under 
construction since shortly after the working group was chartered. The 
first of these, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-applicability/">applicability</a> document, gives pointers on building applications (other than HTTP) on top of QUIC, and the other, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-manageability/">manageability</a>
 document, provides an independent guide to the protocol for operators 
of the networks its traffic will be carried over. Discussion in the WG 
pointed out that this division might not be precisely the right one — 
pointedly, the definition of an abstract interface from the application 
down to QUIC is missing, and doesn’t necessarily belong in either. Work 
on this will ramp up in the weeks before Bangkok.</p>
<p>The Wednesday concluded with the tsvarea session where Brian and Ted (Hardie) presented two IAB documents defining the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-tsvarea-wire-images-path-signals-and-the-internetwork-ahead-brain-trammell-and-ted-hardie-00">wire image and path signals</a>. Further Christoper Paasch and Ian Sweet provided some insights on implementation/deployment challenges for <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-tsvarea-how-hard-can-it-be-adding-multipath-tcp-to-the-upstream-linux-kernel-christoph-paasch-00">MPTCP</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-tsvarea-quic-internet-scale-deployment-on-linux-ian-swett-00">QUIC</a>.</p>
<p>Thursday started of with the usual maprg (Measurement and Analysis 
for Protocols research group) session. The agenda cover a broad spectrum
 of topic including <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-maprg-udp-packet-reordering-ian-swett-00">reordering in QUIC</a>, as well <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-maprg-is-bufferbloat-a-privacy-issue-brian-trammell-00">privacy issue of RTT measurements/bufferbloat</a> presented by Brian and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-maprg-measuring-the-usable-maximum-packet-size-across-internet-paths-how-can-we-make-pmtud-work-gorry-fairhurst-00">measurements of PMTU</a> by Gorry.</p>
<p>Later on in LAMPS we discussed “STAR at large” for adoption.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Yoav’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/102/materials/slides-102-lamps-star-00">presentation</a>
 is very neat, and does a good job discussing the non-web use cases for 
STAR certs (e.g., VPNs, Software defined storage, but also autonomic 
networks).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The WG asks 
us to clarify a few points, in particular how to make the semantics of a
 no-revo cert explicit to relying parties, before taking it as an 
working item.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>So we are back to the desk on this one.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Path Aware Networking (PAN) Research Group 
met midday on Friday, during the last slot of the meeting, for the first
 time as a no-longer-proposed-but-actually-chartered research group. In 
addition to proposed talks, discussion centered around two work items: 
first, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dawkins-panrg-what-not-to-do">review of bad ideas</a> in transport-path cooperation, and second, a start on answering the research group’s <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-panrg-questions">first question</a> about path property definition and representation.</p>
<p>We had the usual amount of fun, high-bandwidth, high-energy hallway 
discussions that make the IETF meeting a pretty special thing. 
&nbsp;Next round, sadly the last one under the aegis of MAMI, is going 
to be Bangkok.&nbsp;Stay tuned!</p>

				<p>On June the 11th the <a href="https://erg.abdn.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Electronics Research Group</a> hosted the MAMI Summer<br>
School on Internet Path Transparency Measurements in Aberdeen, Scotland.<br>
This consisted of a few hands-on workshops, with participation<br>
both on-site and remote via video conference.</p>
<p><img src="src/DfZomfeW0AAhJLb.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;" class="alignnone"></p>
<p>The summer school started with Korian and Justin demonstrating <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/tracebox" target="_blank">Tracebox</a><br>
through a variety of topologies. The participants then worked on their<br>
own trying to uncover middleboxes and hidden topologies using a variety<br>
of tools, including tracebox and paris-traceroute.</p>
<p>To follow, the history and development of <a href="http://pathspider.net/" target="_blank">PATHspider</a> were presented by<br>
Iain Learmonth, one of the creators of PATHspider. Iain also delivered<br>
an interactive Scapy tutorial followed by teaching students how to use<br>
Scapy to create PATHspider plugins using the Evil Bit as an example.<br>
The participants ran plugins against a list of real targets and produced<br>
results.</p>
<p>To finish off, Brian Trammel delivered a presentation on the PTO (Path<br>
Transparency Observatory), and helped the participants upload to it the<br>
results they collected in the previous session. The participants then<br>
learned how to query the PTO in order to examine the data they just<br>
uploaded. In an interesting twist of events, the measurements found ECN<br>
manipulation by a middlebox in the eduroam network in Aberdeen – mission<br>
accomplished!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>On June 25, we held another edition of the <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/2018/mnm-workshop/">Mobile Network Measuremnt (MNM’18)</a> workshop together with the <a href="https://www.monroe-project.eu/">MONROE project</a>. As last year the workshop was co-located with the <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/2018/main-conference/">Network Traffic Measurement and Analysis Conference (TMA 2018)</a> which was held this year in Vienna. We started the day with a keynote from Varun Singh, the CEO of <a href="https://www.callstats.io/">callstats.io</a> – a start-up from Helsinki that collects and analyses <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>
 measurements. While he was giving us some interesting insights in the 
technical work and challenges of monitoring real-time communications, 
his elaborations about the challenges and problems as a young start-up 
were as least as exciting!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-713 aligncenter" src="src/IMG_6868-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
<p>The technical agenda of the workshop were split between 6 talks into 
two sessions, basically between the layers: first focusing on Network 
QoS and (mobile) Coverage, and then Multipath and Application 
Performance (in mobile networks). Further Özgü Alay, the co-ordinator of
 the MONROE project, and Iain Learmonth, the main maintainer of 
PATHSPider, gave an introduction on the use of the MONROE platform and <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/MNM18-Vienna/pathspider-tutorial.pdf">mobile measurements using PATHspider</a>.</p>
<p>One more important thing to mention: We did print MAMI labelled 
M&amp;M’s for the MNM workshop… of course! I’d say those where a big 
success but we gladly have still some left. So if you meet us the next 
time at some event (e.g. come to our <a href="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2018/tutorial-rcm.html">SIGCOMM tutorial on Repeatability and Comparability in Measurement (RCM)</a> where we introduce tracebox, <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pto3-go">PTO</a>), chances are good to get some as well!</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-712 aligncenter" src="src/IMG_6876-300x216.jpg" alt=""  width="300" height="216"></p>
<p>Of course we also stayed for the rest of the TMA meeting in Vienna! Beside our two paper on <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/tma18/ExploringUsable2018-04.pdf"><em>Exploring usable Path MTU in the Internet</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/tma18/pathspider-traceroute.pdf"><em>Tracing Internet Path Transparency</em></a>,
 there where a lot of great talks and keynotes, including an expert 
summit on Tuesday of the week. After all a big thanks to the organizors 
for the great meeting as well as great social events (every night of the
 entire week)!</p>

				<p>Last month, the IETF returned to the Hilton Metropole near Paddington Station in London for its 101st meeting.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_641" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-641" src="src/IMG_6586-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480"><p class="wp-caption-text">Hello, London!</p></div><p></p>
<p>While it is always nice to go to an IETF meeting in Europe (and 
therefore suffer less from jet-lag), in this specific hotel the 
challenge is to find your way around and actually make it to your 
meeting in time. The meeting room are distributed over three “wings” in 
the first as well as ground floors as well as in the upper third and 
“lower third level” (i.e., the sub-basement, next to the Underground), 
with a less than optimal elevator configuration:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXFpog3B8hY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>However, the meeting itself was very productive, despite the 
labyrinth! As is now customary, the week started early on Saturday and 
Sunday already with the Hackathon where MAMI was present with two 
projects and a total of 6 people working on Scalable, Privacy-preserving
 In-Network Measurement (i.e., the QUIC Latency Spin Bit) and a <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/trafic">testbed</a> for 1-bit optimisations for the mobile access network based on the Loss-Latency tradeoff.</p>
<p>Monday, we mainly focused on transport topics with a presentation of the soon-to-be-finished <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn-06">AccECN TCP extension</a>
 in tcpm, an interesting discussion about framing in QUIC (i.e. whether 
or not to use DTLS as QUIC’s wire image), and a general discussion about
 TCP encapsulation in tsvarea.</p>
<p>On Tuesday both of the research groups that have grown out of the MAMI project met: the<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/maprg">Measurement and Analysis for Protocols (MAP)</a> and the proposed <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/panrg">Path Aware Networking (PAN)</a>
 research groups. MAPRG’s two and a half hour slot contained many 
interesting presentations, covering both papers from, e.g., IMC as well 
as “previews” of work presented at PAM 2018 the following week in 
Berlin.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/is3p3aXPIHM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>PANRG met for the third time as a proposed RG, which means that the 
process of actually forming the group officially is underway now. The 
meeting had a productive discussion and a lot of positive feedback, 
indicating that there is interest in continuing work in the group. There
 seem to be two broad areas of research the group will tackle going 
forward: exploring how to add “path awareness” to the Internet 
architecture (in the vein of the <a href="https://trammell.ch/publication/plus-cnsm-2017/">PLUS</a>
 work pursued by the MAMI project), and continuing work on various 
not-yet-ready-for-standardization techniques to use path information at 
the transport layer.</p>
<p>The MAMI project, together with the <a href="https://www.neat-project.org/">H2020 NEAT project</a> and engineers and researchers from Apple, the University of Glasgow, and TU Berlin, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pauly-taps-arch">proposed a new architecture</a> for the Transport Services working group, and an <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-taps-interface">abstract interface</a> for that architecture based in large part on MAMI’s <a href="index.php/2017/03/22/post-sockets-workshop/index.html">Post Sockets</a>
 and flexible transport layer work. These drafts were adopted by the 
TAPS working group, and will form the basis of a new standard abstract 
API for the transport layer.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_638" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-638 size-large" src="src/DY0ucnoUQAEieSr-1024x280.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="175"><p class="wp-caption-text">The
 new TAPS cabal, working out the details after the adoption of the new 
architecture drafts. (Thanks Colin Perkins for the photo!)</p></div><p></p>
<p>MAMI was also busy in TLS, presenting a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-fossati-tls-ext-header-01">proposal</a> to extend the DTLS header and discussing the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/101/materials/slides-101-tls-sessa-dtls13-and-connection-id-00">nuances</a> of the DTLS connection Id encoding, and in ACME where we asked for WGLC of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-acme-star-03">STAR</a> document.</p>
<p>The “main event” for the project, so to say, took place on Thursday morning with a discussion of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-quic-spin">QUIC Spin Bit</a>,
 a facility for supporting passive round-trip time measurement despite 
the encryption of the QUIC header. This discussion took the majority of a
 two and a half hour session, and was quite lively: for the first time 
in our experience at an IETF meeting, the microphones at an IETF meeting
 had to be moved to keep the line from running out the door.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_639" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-639" src="src/quic_mic_line_again-1024x501.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="313"><p class="wp-caption-text">“How many engineers does it take to spin one bit?”</p></div><p></p>
<p>While the working group still could not come to consensus to add the 
spin bit directly to the protocol at this time, the outcome was a good 
one for the project (and for the concept of <a href="https://trammell.ch/publication/ipim-ccr-2017/">explicit measurability</a> and <a href="https://trammell.ch/post/2018-03-29-and-yet-it-spins/">in our opinion, for the Internet at large</a>):
 one bit has been reserved for experimentation with the spin bit, with a
 directive to reserve a further two for experimentation with additional 
signaling such as the Valid Edge Counter (VEC) presented at the meeting,
 with a draft to be published under working group change control for 
coordinating larger-scale experimentation.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a great week in London, and we’re already looking forward to July’s IETF 102 meeting in Montreal!</p>

				<span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a href="index.php/2018/01/12/pathspider-has-exciting-new-features-in-release-2-0-0/index.html" title="12:56 pm" rel="bookmark"><span class="entry-date">January 12, 2018</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="https://iain.learmonth.me/" title="View webpage of Iain R. Learmonth">Iain R. Learmonth</a></span>			</div><!-- .entry-meta -->

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p><a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a>
 is a free-software extensible path transparency measurement tool that 
performs path transparency measurements using either real network stacks
 or packet forging. A new major version, 2.0.0, has just been released 
and is packed with new features to expand the range of measurement tasks
 it can perform.</p>
<p>For the evolution of the Internet’s protocol stack, it is important 
to know which network impairments exist and potentially need to be 
worked around. PATHspider performs A/B testing between two different 
protocols or different protocol extensions to perform controlled 
experiments of protocol-dependent connectivity problems as well as 
differential treatment.</p>
<p>One new feature that can simplify the creation of tests for path 
transparency to new protocols in development is the inclusion of a 
packet forging framework, <a href="https://github.com/phaethon/scapy">Scapy</a> (thanks to Ēriks Dobelis for his work on porting Scapy to Python 3, without which this would not have been possible).</p>
<p>This means that even before the specification for a new protocol or 
extension is written, before any code exists, you can already be testing
 for possible issues. This feature was already used to explore the 
possibilities for a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tsvwg-le-phb-02">new DiffServ codepoint for lower effort traffic</a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/98/slides/slides-98-maprg-le-codepoint-preliminary-results-and-ongoing-work-in-the-ietf-gorry-fairhurst-00.pdf">reported on</a> at an <a href="https://irtf.org/maprg">IRTF MAPRG</a> meeting.</p>
<p>The API for developing plugins for new measurements has also been 
greatly simplified. A lot of effort has gone into refactoring large 
chunks of the codebase to remove code duplication in plugins and ensure 
plugin authors only have to write the code that they need to.</p>
<p>When using real network stacks, connection helpers are now provided for HTTP and DNS using <a href="https://github.com/pycurl/pycurl">pycurl</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/paulc/dnslib/">dnslib</a>.
 This greatly simplifies the creation of plugins that are toggling 
kernel options or iptables rules as you now only need to write the 
function to perform the system-wide configuration and the traffic 
generation is handled for you.</p>
<p>Analysis of data is now also simplified as PATHspider no longer 
outputs individual flows but instead waits for all the flows to be 
available and performs an automated analysis to generate conditions that
 apply to a path, for example whether or not the use of a feature has 
broken connectivity. It will also determine your public IP address if 
behind a NAT, and look up the ASN of the vantage point and include these
 in the computed network path in the output.</p>
<p>A completely new feature in PATHspider allows the <a href="http://pathspider.readthedocs.io/en/stable/using.html#performing-passive-observation">use of the built-in flow meter without actively generating any traffic</a>.
 This can be used to examine another device that is generating traffic 
or to examine traffic on a link aggregating many devices to discover how
 clients behave and what typical Internet traffic looks like with regard
 to the protocol features in use.</p>
<p>PATHspider includes <a href="http://pathspider.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">comprehensive documentation</a>
 to help you get started. If you have Vagrant installed, you can have a 
working PATHspider environment as simply as “vagrant up”. Other 
installation methods are described in the documentation.</p>
<p>In the near future, there will be more work on the test suites that 
allow you to verify the installation of PATHspider is working correctly 
and the addition of a benchmarking command to optimise the speed at 
which PATHspider is running on a particular machine to balance speed 
with dropped packets. There will also be more extensive documentation on
 packaging your plugins so that they can be more easily shared other

<p>In order to complete the inclusion of pycurl for traffic generation, 
it was necessary to add support to pycurl for a couple of additional 
features (thanks to Oleg Pudeyev for reviewing and merging those 
changes). Unfortunately these changes were only recently released and so
 it may be necessary to install pycurl from source. If using the 
Vagrantfile this will be done for you, on a Debian system the following 
will get you going:</p>
<pre>apt-get install python3-libtrace python3-sphinx python3-straight.plugin python3-setuptools pylint3 python3-pep8 python3-pyroute2 python3-pip unzip python3-nose python3-stem
apt-get build-dep python3-pycurl
pip3 install 'pycurl&gt;=7.43.0.1'
pip3 install 'pathspider&gt;=2.0.0'
</pre>

				<p></p><div id="attachment_600" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-600 size-large" src="src/IMG_6285-1024x230.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="144"><p class="wp-caption-text">Good morning, Singapore!</p></div><p></p>
<p class="p1">A few of us from the MAMI project started arriving in 
Singapore on Friday, in order to participate in the hackathon, which has
 become an IETF tradition. A few hours later we were at our tables, 
Thomas Fossati and James Bulmer working on a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-sheffer-acme-star-request/">STAR Requests</a> implementation, and Brian Trammell sitting with the QUIC and TLS tables to work on passive measurability of the protocol with <a href="http://github.com/britram/mokumokuren">mokumkuoren</a>.
 We had a day and a half of fun coding, patching specs, improving test 
coverage, and generally hacking about.&nbsp; Pretty good progress 
indeed, a few nice chats with old and new friends and great food and 
beers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>Thank you <a href="https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp">hackathon organisers</a>!</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_605" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-605" src="src/IMG_6284-e1511370669769-1024x476.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="298"><p class="wp-caption-text">Test coverage improved by the end of the hackathon…</p></div><p></p>
<p class="p1">The next step for STAR is to get the e2e demo up &amp; running on our dear <a href="https://twitter.com/nekiniee/status/856029945499459584">Blue Box</a> with a miniaturised but fully functional CDN talking to an ACME STAR CA in time for IETF 101 in London in March.</p>
<p class="p1">Back to the hotel we posted <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sheffer-acme-star-request-01">acme-star-01</a>, since we had missed the pre-IETF cutoff date and we needed people to get a chance to glance through the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfcdiff?url2=draft-ietf-acme-star-01.txt">changes</a> which had been quite abundant. The updated draft includes<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>an “implementation status” section (as per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7942">BCP205</a>) documenting the work that Diego De Aguilar Cañellas has done on top of <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">Boulder</a> and <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> (LetsEncrypt’s server and EFF’s client, respectively) to add the new STAR flow in ACME.</p>
<p class="p1">Then Monday arrived, and the meeting started. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/Diego%20Lopez">Diego</a> went to TRANS to talk about ACME STAR (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-trans-short-lived-certificates-and-certificate-transparency/">slides</a>)&nbsp;and discuss the cost that an increase in log ingestion of one or two orders of magnitude poses on the <a href="https://www.certificate-transparency.org/">Certificate Transparency</a>
 infrastructure. Based on the observation that all STARs belonging to 
the same ACME order are basically equivalent modulo their validity dates
 and serial number, we also prepared and presented a napkin design that 
uses a new SCT type to address the scale problem. The discussion (<a href="https://youtu.be/fqug9TvRgbE?t=828">youtube link</a>)
 was, as often happens in the IETF, very instructive but inconclusive. 
We went away without a clear answer whether this is going to cause 
troubles or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The 
reactions up to this point are scattered all over the spectrum, ranging 
from “omg, this will melt the world” to “nah, the log can cope” to “meh,
 future problems”.</p>
<p>Monday’s session of the Measurement and Analysis of Protocols 
research group (MAPRG), co-chaired by Mirja Kühlewind, included a 
presentation by Brian of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3089264">Principles for Measurability in Protocol Design</a> (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-maprg-principles-for-measurability-in-protocol-design-brian-trammell/">slides</a>). This paper articulates our vision for measurement as a first-class function of the protocol stack.</p>

<p>Tuesday started off with the Transport Services (TAPS) WG, where 
discussion focused on whether the working group should take on work in 
defining abstract programming interfaces for applications atop a dynamic
 . Here, discussion focused on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-trammell-taps-post-sockets">Post Sockets</a>,
 a realization of MAMI’s flexible transport layer (FTL). We came to no 
conclusion, but will schedule a meeting in the margins of our upcoming 
plenary in Cambridge in January to further develop Post Sockets into an 
architecture for flexible transport services.</p>

<p class="p1">The first session of QUIC was Tuesday afternoon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> A </span>slightly congested mic line and <a href="https://twitter.com/nielstenoever/status/930330701664206848">very robust discussion</a> surrounded the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-quic-sessa-spin-bit-evaluation-design-team-report/">wrap up</a>
 of the design team for the “spin bit”, designed to provide explicit 
passive measurability of end-to-end latency in QUIC flows, replacing TCP
 timestamps for this purpose.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> While 
the design team itself was unable to come to consensus to add the spin 
but to the protocol (though it did conclude that passive latency 
measurement <a href="index.php/2017/08/30/is-internet-rtt-reliable-for-geolocation/index.html">poses no known threat to privacy</a>),
 there was a balance of support in the room for adding passive latency 
measurability to the protocol, and a sense that the spin bit is a good 
method for doing so. However, work to achieve consensus is ongoing; 
watch this space for future posts about our experiences with <a href="https://devae.re/f/eth/quic/spinbit_report/">implementation and use of the spin bit</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1">Thursday was definitely a busy day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In TLS we did the call for adoption for the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-rescorla-tls-dtls-connection-id/">connection identifier for (D)TLS</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>That went really smooth and the draft has been adopted – pending confirmation on the mailing list, obviously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
 co-authors have slightly different opinions on a few key points, 
including implicit vs explicit signals and the protocol friendliness to 
troubleshooting (deja-vu?).<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>But we all agree this solves the big issues related to connection migration and NAT rebinding that we already discussed in a <a href="index.php/2017/03/28/frist-prize-at-ietf98-hackathon-for-connection-identifier-in-dtls-group/index.html">previous post</a> and the important thing here is that the TLS working group reckons this is worth spending working group cycles on.</p>
<p>Thursday afternoon saw the second meeting of the Path Aware Networking research group (PANRG), and included presentations on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-panrg-01-dissemination-of-paths-in-path-aware-networks/">path property dissemination</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-panrg-02-interfaces-for-path-selection/">interfaces for path control</a> (hello again, Post Sockets), as well as an examination of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/100/materials/slides-100-panrg-06-open-questions/">open questions</a>
 in bringing path awareness to the Internet architecture. We see the 
general area of path-aware networking as being an unexpected legacy of 
the project.</p>
<p class="p1">Later, in the ACME session we presented the updates we’d been working on in the months following Prague.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
 document is in good shape, the protocol flow should be stable and my 
impression is that once we complete the security and operational 
analysis, the document should be ready for last call. After ACME, we had
 another informal STAR-centred meeting organised by <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/person/Yoav%20Nir">Yoav</a> to talk about generic <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-nir-saag-star/">short-lived certificates that automatically renew</a>
 which may or may not depend on the ACME ecosystem – for example, based 
on ANIMA, or on proprietary systems – and may or may not address the 
HTTPS use case and address instead IPsec, non-web uses of TLS &amp; SSH 
in enterprise and datacentre-type environments.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
 meeting was well attended with more than 20 people at the table (a 
couple of CDNs, middlebox vendors, web folks, mobile network operators, 
academia, other SDOs) all bringing their own experience and perspective 
on the issues related to certificate revocation (one of the core 
motivations to look into STAR) and the solution space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>The
 discussion was great – with use cases in NSF, vehicle-to-vehicle, SAN, 
IPsec, and of course the Web – though a tad too short: many had to run, 
including Diego and I to our traditional MAMI dinner <img draggable="false" class="emoji" alt="🙂" src="src/1f642.svg"><span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>One
 core thing that was concluded is that the “short” in short-term is a 
very fluid concept and must be defined on a case by case basis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>In
 fact, the exact definition of “short” should match the time it takes to
 the revocation information (CRL and/or OCSP) to propagate to the 
relying parties.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>We hope to continue the exchange on the SAAG list or maybe in an ad-hoc list.</p>

				<p>Short, short answer: <strong>nope</strong>, don’t bother. While this is probably obvious to any of you with network engineering experience, we thought we’d use <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a> to have a look into this question anyway.</p>
<p>In the context of an <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/issues/631">ongoing conversation</a>
 about the explicit exposure of RTT information to devices on path in 
the IETF standard version of the QUIC protocol, we’ve briefly looked 
into how much of a threat Internet-observable per-path RTT is to 
geoprivacy of one of the endpoints. It turns out that the old network 
operations rule of thumb that a millisecond of RTT is 100km long adds a 
whole lot of uncertainty — a fact which also confounded some <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7470242/">recent work </a>on
 RTT-based anycast detection by Cicalese et al. Only in cases where one 
is very, very lucky — microseconds lucky — in the placement of the 
vantage points from which RTT measurements are taken can one use RTT 
measurements for elimination-based geolocation.</p>

				<p>Two weeks ago, 16-21 July 2017, the IETF returned to Prague, as 
it apparently does every few years now, and the MAMI project went with 
it.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_552" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-552 size-large" src="src/20170722_0148-1024x412.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="258"><p class="wp-caption-text">Charles Bridge at night</p></div><p></p>

<p>As with last summer’s IETF (96, in Berlin), our meeting started a day
 early with the ACM/IRTF Applied Networking Research Workshop&nbsp;(<a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/">ANRW</a>), with two MAMI papers on the <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2017/program.html">program</a>: Korian Edeline presented <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2017/anrw17-final5.pdf">copycat</a>, a differential TCP/UDP treatment tool; and Piet De Vaere presented <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2017/anrw17-final16.pdf">our latest results</a> with <a href="https://pathspider.net/"><em>PATHspider</em></a>
 on ECN, DCSP and TFO measurements. In addition, putting the “applied” 
in ANRW, discussions&nbsp;at the final panel may lead to efforts to do 
some simple standardization for data interchange formats for very simple
 measurements; watch this space for future announcements.</p>
<p>The IETF meeting proper kicked off on Monday morning with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/tcpm/about/">TCPM</a>
 where most discussion was focused around TCP’s Explicit Congestion 
Nodification (ECN). The MAMI project is working on an extension for <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tcpm-accurate-ecn-03">more accurate ECN feedback (AccECN)</a>
 that can be used as input for future, more advantage congestion control
 schemes. With the ECN deployment efforts from Apple and hopefully ECN 
support <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-johansson-quic-ecn/">by default in QUIC</a>, this can provide an interesting new space for research and experimentation.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, Brian Trammell of MAMI partner ETH co-chaired a 
second BoF on bandwidth aggregation approaches for multiply connected 
networks (BANANA); the discussion was much more focused than <a href="index.php/2016/12/01/mami-at-ietf97/index.html">that in Seoul</a>, and we anticipate a decision as to whether a working group will be formed soon.</p>
<p>Work on <a href="index.php/2017/03/22/post-sockets-workshop/index.html">Post Sockets</a>-related drafts continued at the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/taps/about/">TAPS</a> working group meeting on Tuesday. Discussions in the working group focused on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-pauly-taps-transport-security/">how to add security</a> to the model of transport services worked out in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8095/">RFC 8095</a>. It has also become clear that discussions about the details of transport policies (addressed in depth by our sister <a href="https://www.neat-project.org/">NEAT project</a>)
 will be central to the usability of a flexible transport layer (FTL) as
 envisioned by the MAMI project, and we will work together with the TAPS
 working group to define common policy models for future APIs. The 
authors of the Post Sockets draft also met after the WG meeting to 
discuss next steps with the document and bringing it up to date with our
 <a href="https://trammell.ch/pdf/post-fit.pdf">recently published paper</a>. In addition, the MAMI project started new work in operation with Apple on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-kuehlewind-taps-crypto-sep/">security features in the transport stack</a>.</p>

<p>Going on, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ippm/about/">IPPM</a> working group decided on Wednesday to attempt to change its charter to allow it to work, among other things, on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-brockners-inband-oam-data/">OAM work</a> discussed <a href="index.php/2017/04/10/what-happened-at-ietf98-in-chicago-march-26-31/index.html">in Chicago</a>, which, as we noted, addresses some of the goals of MAMI MCP.</p>
<p>Wednesday afternoon marked the first meeting of the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/panrg/about/">Path Aware Networking (PAN)</a>
 proposed Research Group, co-chaired by Brian Trammell of MAMI partner 
ETH and Jen Linkova, a Google network engineer. PAN expands the question
 addressed by the MAMI project somewhat: what can we do with network 
architectures, protocols, and applications, when the endpoints are made 
explicitly aware of the paths between them and their properties? The 
creation of an IRTF research group as a venue to have these discussions 
will, we believe, be a major unanticipated outcome of the MAMI project, 
so we’ll go into more depth about PAN in a future blog post.</p>
<p>Thursday morning started with the usual <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/maprg/about/">MAPRG</a>
 session chaired by Mirja Kühlewind, the MAMI project coordinator. Other
 than the last time, there was no Call for Contributions as the list of 
proposed presentation was just growing continuously. Check out the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/agenda-99-maprg">agenda</a> for various talks on IPv6, DNS hijacking, or latency measurements. Or watch the <a href="https://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/map">recording</a>.
 Please also consider to announce your measurement work in the maprg 
mailing list or use the mailing to check out if someone has that to 
share that might help your research work!</p>
<p>While the MAMI project was initially focused on the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-plus-spec">definition of a common wire image</a> for encrypted transport protocols, it has become clear that <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/quic/about/">QUIC</a>
 is the currently-important such protocol under standardization in the 
IETF, so we focus our efforts on applying the principles we work out in 
the project to QUIC, as well. Thursday’s QUIC session was largely 
focused on discussion of the addition of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/99/materials/slides-99-quic-sessa-quic-passive-rtt-measurements">explicit round-trip-time measurability</a>
 to the protocol.&nbsp;For such a basic observable metric as latency, 
this discussion was surprisingly contentious, showing that emotions 
continue to run high in the IETF on the question of support for network 
management functions. On this particular question, we anticipate closure
 at the next IETF meeting in Singapore in November; watch this space for
 a future blog post on the details of the question.</p>
<p>While you might already got the impression that the meeting was 
packed, there was&nbsp; more stuff to report also on Friday. Beside a 
second QUIC meeting where among other things ECN support in QUIC was 
discussed, there was the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/acme/about/">ACME</a> session. Work on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-acme-star/">certificate delegation</a>
 that was adopted by the working group at the last interim was presented
 there. Further it should be noted that the MAMI project was also 
presented at the IETF hackathon on Sunday, with <a href="https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf99-project-presentations/blob/master/acme-star%2Bllt/slides.pdf">ACME STAR and LoLa</a>.</p>

<p>On June 20, we had a joint workshop with the <a href="https://www.monroe-project.eu/">EU-H2020 MONROE</a> project on Mobile Network Measurements (MNM). The workshop was held in conjunction with <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/workshops/mnm17-workshop/">TMA Conference 2017</a>
 in Dublin/Maynooth which was a great fit for this workshop and our 
project given the strong focus on measurements we have in WP1. For us 
the goal of the workshop was two-fold: of course it’s a good opportunity
 to disseminate the goals and results of our two projects but it was 
also a great chance to meet up with people that use or plan to use the 
MONROE testbed as well as <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mnm2017_paper5.pdf">PATHspider which is available on MONROE</a> and build a focused community&nbsp; around this group of people.</p>
<p>The workshop received 16 paper contributions, and <a href="http://tma.ifip.org/workshops/mnm17-workshop/">10 6-page papers</a>
 were selected by the TPC, consisting of participants from both projects
 as well as MAMI EAB members, for presentation at the workshop. At this 
point again a big thanks to all TPC members, providing reviews within an
 incredibly short period of only two weeks!</p>
<p>The workshop was organized in three technical sessions focusing on 
network performance in mobile networks (like congestion forecasting or 
available bandwidth estimation) as well as application performance (e.g.
 Video QoE) over a mobile network and middlebox mangling in mobile 
networks (such as DCSP rewrites and NAT). The technical session where 
supplemented by a keynote on “From packets to knowledge: applying data 
science approaches to traffic measurement” held by Marco Mellia, 
Politecnico di Torino, Italy.</p>
<p>With a total of 18 registered participants, and a couple of visitors 
from the parallel workshops, the workshop provided lively discussion and
 a good opportunity to make people aware of MAMI’s measurement efforts, 
raising interest in a focused community of MONROE users as well as other
 researchers working on Internet measurements in academia and industry. 
And we are already discussing to have another workshop next year again!</p>

				<p>The QUIC transport protocol, developed by Google and currently 
under standardization in the IETF, is of central interest to our 
project. QUIC is an encrypted transport protocol encapsulated in UDP, as
 those we aim to support with our MCP; indeed, our pilot MCP 
implementation targets QUIC as its overlying transport. So we are 
naturally very interested in QUIC’s development, and MAMI partners ETH 
(Mirja Kühlewind and Brian Trammell, in person) and UoA (Gorry 
Fairhurst, remotely) attended an interim meeting of the QUIC WG last 
week in Paris.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-521" src="src/20170610_0162-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="426"></p>
<p>The meeting focused on laying out the features of a draft version of 
the protocol for the first interop test. As the interface between QUIC 
and TLS is entirely new and somewhat complex, interoperability will 
focus on connection establishment with cryptographic 
handshaking.&nbsp;Also on the agenda were discussions about the 
measurability of QUIC: how much information should QUIC explicitly 
radiate about its operation toward devices on path in order to support 
measurement, similar as questions we discuss for MCP. Here discussion is
 ongoing, but it seems that consensus on a set of explicit mechanisms 
for limited measurement and operations task is closer than it has been.</p>

				<p style="text-align: left">In light of the IPv4 address scarcity 
problem, one approach towards prolonging the life of current IPv4 
address allocations is to deploy Carrier Grade NATs (CGNs), where 
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) share the same public IPv4 address 
across multiple end users. &nbsp;CGNs may bring a number of challenges 
for end users, service providers, content providers and government 
authorities. For example, there is some evidence that CGNs can cause 
dropped services in peer-to-peer applications, and lead to low 
performance of file transfer and video streaming sessions. Despite all 
this, CGNs offer an immediate relief to the IPv4 address scarcity 
problem, so it is likely that their popularity will increase over time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="size-medium wp-image-510 alignright" src="src/CGN-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200"></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Given the 
potentially disruptive impact of what seems a likely future scenario, it
 behooves policymakers, ISPs and Internet users to monitor the extent of
 CGN deployment in the Internet. But like many aspects of Internet 
structure, systematic measurement and monitoring of CGN deployment in 
the wide area is challenging. The MAMI project through Simula Research 
Laboratory, together with external collaborators at <a href="http://netcom.it.uc3m.es/">University Carlos III of Madrid</a> and <a href="http://www.caida.org/home/">CAIDA/UCSD</a> worked towards addressing this challenge. We built and perfected <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/revelio"><strong>NAT Revelio</strong></a>,
 a tool that enables us to actively determine from within residential 
networks the type of upstream network address translation, namely NAT at
 the home gateway (customer-grade NAT) or NAT in the ISP (Carrier Grade 
NAT). Check our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qosh1zJz4bM">talk</a> at <a href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/pam2016/">PAM 2016</a> for an overview of how Revelio works.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">We deployed Revelio on two large-scale hardware-based measurement platforms – <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a> in Europe and the <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/measuring-broadband-america">FCC Measuring Broadband America</a>
 (FCC-MBA) in the U.S. – with a total of 5,121 vantage points in over 60
 ISPs. The FCC-MBA deployment consisted of 2,477 home routers operated 
by <a href="https://www.samknows.com/">SamKnows</a> in
 21 large residential broadband Internet access service providers in the
 U.S. We also executed the Revelio tests from 2,644 Atlas probes in 43 
ISPs mainly active in Europe. We ran the measurement campaign in two 
phases (May 2016 and August 2016) on both platforms. Based on the 
experimental results from the first phase (May 2016), we enhanced the 
test suite to account for a wide diversity of home network topologies 
and various access technologies. In the second phase of the measurement 
campaign (August 2016) we deployed the evolved Revelio suite to 
investigate the state of CGN deployment in broadband networks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Our results show that </span><b>10% (6 out of 64) of the ISPs we tested have some form of CGN deployment.</b><span style="font-weight: 400">
 In particular, one ISP has a large-scale deployment where Revelio 
detected upstream CGN deployment from all 76 vantage points in that ISP.
 In the other 5 ISPs we observed evidence of a localized deployment 
limited to a subset of customers. We verified our results with 
representatives of the ISPs to validate our positive and negative 
inferences </span><b>at the IP level</b><span style="font-weight: 400">. We confirmed the results for 4 of the 6 positive ISPs by personal communications with ISP representatives. </span><b>The combination of the FCC-MBA and RIPE Atlas study represents (to the best of our knowledge) the largest <em>active</em> measurement study to date with </b><b>confirmed</b><b> CGN deployments in broadband networks at the IP-level granularity.</b></p>

				<p>Expecting an usual, not particular special IETF meeting, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/98/agenda.html">98th meeting</a>
 two weeks ago in Chicago was actually quite exciting, in a positive 
sense. A lot of work, relevant to the architecture as well as 
measurement objectives of the MAMI project, made good progress and 
fostered interesting, still on-going discussions.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-484 aligncenter" src="src/IMG_4355-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
<p>The meeting started off with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/ippm/about/">IP Performanec Metrics (IPPM)</a> session Monday morning. A document on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-brockners-inband-oam-data/">In-situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) </a>proposing
 a data model for telemetry and measurement data that can be applied to 
different (tunneling) protocols was discussed and received positive 
feedback from the group. This work is highly relevant to MAMI given 
measurement is one of the basic use cases for the Middlebox Cooperation 
protocol (MCP).</p>
<p>In the afternoon, there were several talks on middlebox benefits, 
state management, and privacy in the tsv-area meeting. Dave Dolsen 
presented <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits/">draft-dolson-plus-middlebox-benefits</a> and Brian Trammel (remotely) presented <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-plus-statefulness/">draft-trammell-plus-statefulness</a>.
 Both drafts created quite some interest as well as discussion – any 
information that is exposed by an endpoint must first demonstrate 
benefits when consumed by the network.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-487 aligncenter" src="src/IMG_4280-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
<p>Tuesday morning the IRTF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/maprg/about/">Measurement and Analysis for Protocols</a>
 (maprg) had a long slot with a number of presentations on security and 
privacy relevant topics. maprg usually sends out a Call for 
Contributions a couple of weeks ahead of the meeting. This time the 
group had a large number of very interesting submissions and could 
finally accept only about half of them to fit in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/98/agenda/maprg/">2.5h slot</a>.
 The talks presented data on DSCP, ECN, IPv6, Let’sEncrypt, broadcasted 
hostnames, weak keys in HTTPS, and censorship detected by the <a href="https://ooni.torproject.org/">OONI</a> project.</p>
<p>In the last session on Tuesdays Tommy Pauly presented <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-taps-post-sockets/">Post Sockets</a> in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/taps/about/">Transport Services (taps)</a> working group which is common work with the MAMI project updated after an <a href="index.php/2017/03/22/post-sockets-workshop/index.html">one day workshop held in Feburary in Zürich</a>.</p>
<p>Thursday started with the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/quic/about/">QUIC</a> meeting were Mirja Kühlewind presented two drafts on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kuehlewind-quic-applicability">Applicability</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-kuehlewind-quic-manageability">Managability</a> as well as a proposal by Brian Trammell to add a <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/base-drafts/pull/393">packet number echo</a>
 to the public QUIC header for RTT measurements. The draft received 
positive feedback to address one of the charter milestones and adoption 
will be confirmed on the mailing list. The proposal to add a packet 
number echo was lively discussed without reaching consensus yet. There 
was broad support for this addition but there were also privacy concerns
 that needs further discussion; similar to all information that will be 
exposed for network use in the header. QUIC will hold an <a href="https://github.com/quicwg/wg-materials/blob/master/interim-17-06/arrangements.md">interim meeting on June 6-8 in Paris</a>.</p>
<p>Later that day, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/mptcp/about/">Multipath TCP</a>
 working group discussed the use of MPTCP for bandwidth aggregation in 
network scenarios where one low bandwidth fixed line link (DSL) is 
bonded with a high speed mobile link (LTE). Several approaches to 
address this use case have been proposed but there was so far no real 
consensus to move any of them forward. This time the discussion was led 
by the chairs attempting to compare the different proposals on a high 
level allowing the group to move forward. While there were also quite 
some people who indicated that they think this work should not be taken 
up by the IETF at all, a larger group of people were interested in this 
work and there was a clear indication for one of the proposals which is a
 solution that only requires a small addition to the SYN payload on the 
bonding link. The MAMI project is also focusing on this use case, using 
the MCP to signal preferences of the endhost to the bonding boxes in the
 network.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-486 aligncenter" src="src/IMG_5033-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300">Thursday
 afternoon finally also the new MAMI T-shirts arrived (see photo above).
 Unfortunatly, they came only in to action during the bits-and-bytes and
 Friday morning that is traditionally rather quite. However, the next 
event is comig and the next IETF is already on the horizon in July in 
Prague! See you there! Good bye, Chicago!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>On Saturday and Sunday at the IETF there always is a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/hackathon/98-hackathon.html">Hackathon</a>. This time at IETF-98 members of the MAMI consoritum were working on the implementation of the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tls-cid-00">“connection identifier” in DTLS</a>, a fairly recent proposal Hannes Tschofenig, Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos, and Thomas Fossati brought to the TLS working group.<br>
The problem this proposal addresses is that an end-to-end DTLS session 
may silently die because an on-path Network Address Translation (NAT) 
middlebox dropped state after a (relatively) short period of quiescence.
 There is known trouble with UDP, as transport used by DTLS, that 
in-network state for this kind of traffic tends to vanish much more 
quickly than its TCP counterpart. As an example, the default timeout 
settings in the latest Linux kernel are 5 days for TCP and only 3 
minutes for UDP — that is, three orders of magnitude!</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_477" style="width: 461px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-477" src="src/IETF-Hackathon-Chicago-001-300x183.jpg" alt=""width="451" height="275"><p class="wp-caption-text">© Stonehouse Photographic/Internet Society <br> IETF Hackathon, Chicago 25/03/2017</p></div><p></p>
<p>Obviously, there is a good reason for that: since UDP is 
connectionless, layer 4 devices have no way to possibly track a 
“connection” other than deep inspecting the flow, which is a pretty 
expensive activity. So it’s simpler for it to leave the onus of proving 
that a given UDP 4-tuple has an associated connection to the endpoints, 
by forcing them to regularly move bytes across. This state of affairs is
 clearly far from ideal for DTLS because, when a timeout happens in the 
NAT box, the victim endpoints need to re-negotiate a new crypto session 
context.</p>
<p>While this is generally annoying, it becomes even more nasty in cases
 where the client is a resource constrained, battery operated IoT device
 that woke up from its sleep cycle only to find its session doesn’t work
 anymore… The second nuisance is that the state that is dropped on the 
NAT box immediately becomes dead state in the server, consuming precious
 resources in vain. So, one popular workaround is to create synthetic 
“keep-alive” traffic, for example using the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520">TLS heartbeat extension</a>.
 This technique is a) not very robust (choosing the right keep-alive 
clocking depends on many external factors), and b) certainly, not 
affordable at smaller device scales, where waking up the “thing” to keep
 the NAT binding happy has the potential to quickly drain its battery.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_477" style="width: 383px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-478 aligncenter" src="src/image3063-300x214.png" alt="" width="373" height="266"><p class="wp-caption-text">© Stonehouse Photographic/Internet Society</p></div><p></p>
<p><strong>Our solution – provide a connection identifier!</strong>&nbsp;
 We propose to add a 32-bits blob that does one very simple thing: it 
decouples the DTLS session from the underlying 4-tuple, making it 
possible for the endpoints to dispatch incoming UDP traffic to the 
correct crypto session independently of any change in the underlying UDP
 address.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds simple, right?</strong>&nbsp; Yes, conceptually — apart from the birthday paradox hitting hard at large scales (see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tls-cid-00#section-4">https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mavrogiannopoulos-tls-cid-00#section-4</a>). What we discovered at the <em>Hackathon</em>
 is that backporting it to an existing stack (ARM’s mbedTLS) can be more
 difficult than expected if one needs to maintain API compatibility.</p>
<p>Another practical complication is signaling the wire format change to
 the receiving endpoint so that it can parse the incoming frame 
correctly.&nbsp; This is easy when you can make breaking changes (for 
example, when transitioning from 1.2 to 1.3).&nbsp; Not as much if you 
have to maintain backwards compatibility with existing and deployed 
versions of the protocol. We have been discussing a couple of possible 
solutions around this issue — namely: using the Version field, or moving
 to an extensible record layer format.&nbsp; We are still undecided on 
what “the right” approach would be.</p>
<p>Note that there are interesting privacy implications related to using
 a visible and potentially long-term identifier due to the obvious 
linkability properties of such a construct. Even if not all the use 
cases are problematic in this respect, some of them are, and thus we 
designed (but not yet implemented) a privacy friendly connection 
identifier based on <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226">HMAC-based One-time Password (HOTP)</a> which can be rotated at client’s will at any point in time.</p>
<p><strong>Enough with the babbling!</strong> If you read up to this point you will be glad to know the hackathon judges rewarded our herculean effort with the first prize. <strong>Yay!</strong></p>

				<p>MAMI partner ETH Zürich hosted a small workshop last month to 
discuss a topic central to our vision: how to move network programming 
beyond the 1980s-era <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/socketpair.2.html">BSD sockets</a>
 API.&nbsp;&nbsp;The workshop had two main goals. First, to sync up and 
share&nbsp;concepts about abstract programming interfaces among 
researchers and developers working on future networking stacks. Several 
partners from our H2020 sister project <a href="https://www.neat-project.org/">NEAT</a>, which has a more explicit focus on how applications see the network and transport layer, were in attendance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-465" src="src/post-sockets.png" alt="" width="407" height="349">Our second goal with the workshop was to further develop the concepts in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-trammell-taps-post-sockets/">Post Sockets</a>
 abstract programming interface. Post Sockets is explicitly asynchronous
 and message oriented, which is a better match to most network 
applications and all future transport protocols than the 
single-streamed&nbsp;<code>SOCK_STREAM</code> service offered by TCP. It
 breaks the hard relationship between a connection (called a “carrier” 
in Post, since it carries messages) and the path(s) carrying it, and 
separates short-term transport layer state&nbsp;(“transients” which hold
 transport-protocol specific information such as current sequence 
numbers and flow control windows) from longer-term state (“associations”
 which hold state such as cryptographic resumption parameters), allowing
 generalized fast resumption of sessions for commonly-communicating 
endpoint pairs. Like the NEAT API, it is intended to be 
transport-protocol independent, and interoperating with NEAT’s policy 
engine and transport protocol selection machinery is a goal of MAMI’s 
Post Sockets work.</p>
<p>Our current work on Post Sockets in MAMI focuses on implementation 
details: how message carriers, associations, and transients bind to 
underlying transport protocol implementations, specifically in 
situations with multiple candidate transport and network layer 
protocols, and where network address translation makes rendezvous 
non-trivial. Tommy Pauly from Apple will present Post Sockets at the 
IETF <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/taps/about/">taps</a> session <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/98/agenda.html#2017-03-29-080000">next week</a> in Chicago (checkout <a href="https://ietf98.conf.meetecho.com/">remote participation</a>). Also watch this space for future announcements.</p>
<p>We thank the workshop attendees for a very productive conversation, 
and look forward to working together in the future to drag network APIs 
into the twenty-first century!</p>

				<p>One of the core objectives of the MAMI project is to perform 
measurements and collect measurement data that can help to quantify 
middlebox impairments on the Internet. While various impairments on 
different layers of the protocol stack have been detected over the 
years, the provided measurement data are often not sufficient to assess 
how much of a problem there actually is. This information is needed to 
guide development of protocols extension or new protocols such as the 
Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (MCP) as proposed by MAMI.</p>
<p>Over the last year the MAMI project developed and implemented the 
Path Transparency Observatory (PTO), an open-source and publicly 
accessible repository for measurements of path transparency. An Internet
 path between a vantage point and a target is consider transparent if no
 impairment has been observed on that path and therefore the packet was 
successfully received without modification. The goal of the PTO is to 
collect data from different sources usually in different formats and 
represent them in a comparable way. To achieve this we apply a 
pre-processing step that transform the raw data in <i>observations</i> of a network <i>condition <b>c</b></i> on a <i>path <b>p</b></i> during a <i>time interval <b>t</b></i>.</p>
<p>In parallel we also developed <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PATHspider</a>
 (see below), an active measurement tool for A/B testing which now also 
integrates upload facilities for the PTO. We used and are using 
PATHspider as well as other measurements tools such as tracebox to 
continuously run measurements to test TCP extensions such as ECN or TFO 
as well as impairments on protocols on other layers such as the use of 
the DiffServ codepoint. Currently, only observations for our ECN 
measurement campaigns of the last couple of month are available over the
 public PTO interface. However, we have collected more raw data and are 
currently running the needed processing steps to successively release 
more observation data to be publicly available in the PTO: <a href="https://observatory.mami-project.eu/">https://observatory.mami-project.eu/</a></p>
<p>For more information check out the <a href="index.php/papers/index.html">ANRW PTO paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/aims-mar17/observing-path-transparency-aims2017.pdf">Brian Trammell’s talk</a> at the CAIDA AIMS workshop today! And of course, we will announce on twitter when more data is available!</p>

<p>Since then, PATHspider has gained its own target list resolvers and 
has generalised for performing far more than just the ECN-dependent

plugins it can now perform measurements relating to other TCP features 
such as TCP Fast Open, and IP features such as DiffServ.</p>

<ul>
<li>seamless <a href="https://www.monroe-project.eu/">MONROE</a> integration,</li>
<li>support for workflows integrating with the MAMI Path Transparency Observatory,</li>
<li>…and of course, new measurement plugins.</li>

				<p>On Feb 7/8 the MAMI project met in Seville for the third 
technical plenary meeting. Besides the great Spanish food and tapas 
crawl organized and guided by our technical project coordinator Diego 
Lopez, we made good progress on the technical aspects of the of the 
project.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-433 aligncenter" src="src/seville-meeting-300x221.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="221">We
 discussed next steps on PATHspider, both using PATHspider for more 
measurements as well as the development of new features in PATHspider. 
Currently the integrating into the MONROE testbed is underway. Further, 
potential integration with OONI was discussed to extend censorship 
measurements to low layer mechanisms. We plan for a new release in the 
next couple of month. Check out GitHub for the current implementation 
status and details on planned extensions.</p>
<p>The MAMI middlebox taxonomy that will be published end of June in 
D2.1 feeds into the development of PATHspider and other measurement 
tools by providing input to define a formalized test description and 
conditions to measured. Measurement data describing conditions of path 
transparency observations will soon be publicly available over the Path 
Transparency Observatory frontend webpage.</p>
<p>The MAMI project is also working on the specification of the 
Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (see draft-trammell-plus-spec), planning 
an endpoint implementation using QUIC as transport layer protocol for an
 HTTP/2 web service example use case and a fd.io based middlebox 
implementation supporting network diagnostics and differential treatment
 for low latency services.</p>

				<p>As part of our continued effort to measure Internet path transparency with <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PathSpider</a>, we’ve&nbsp;taken&nbsp;a look at the state of deployment and potential impairments to TCP Fast Open. <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7413">TCP Fast Open</a>
 is an extension to TCP that allows data to be placed on the first (SYN)
 packet of the TCP handshake, eliminating a round-trip time from TCP 
connections. It uses a TCP Option to exchange a cookie to be used on 
subsequent fast open connection attempts, to reduce the risk of 
TFO-based denial of service attacks.Interference with this option could 
cause path impairment of TFO, and indeed Christoph Paasch <a href="https://www.nanog.org/sites/default/files/Paasch_Network_Support.pdf">has reported</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;this is the case on about 20% of the access networks he observed.</p>
<p>We set out to measure possible impairment on content provision 
networks and in the Internet core, and found instead that 
TFO&nbsp;deployment on popular Web servers is mostly&nbsp;limited to 
Google, who invented TFO. Of 939,680 web servers taken from the <a href="index.php/2016/12/08/a-public-targets-list/index.html">Public Targets List</a>&nbsp;(PTL),&nbsp;only
 866 (0.092%) negotiated TFO in measurements taken this week. 690 (about
 79.7%) of these are Google servers. Compared to measurements taken in 
October 2016, we see no appreciable change; then 563 of 635,681 web 
servers (0.086%) negotiated TFO. This is unsurprising, given that TFO 
requires significant changes to both client-side and server-side 
application logic as well as kernel support on both endpoints, we expect
 slow adoption compared, e.g., to <a href="index.php/2016/06/13/70-of-popular-web-sites-support-ecn/index.html">ECN</a>.</p>
<p>The story on DNS, where TFO is part of an effort to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dprive/charter/">improve query privacy</a>&nbsp;by
 using TLS and TCP for DNS, is similar: of the 53,267 authoritative name
 servers taken from the PTL, 56 (0.105\%) negotiate TFO, only&nbsp;three
 of which are not Google name servers; two of those three use an 
experimental ID, and fail to ACK data on the SYN.</p>

				<p>Comparability of measurements and repeatability of experiments is
 key to science, and active Internet measurement studies are no 
different. Active measurement studies need not only open descriptions of
 the experiment (preferably with <a href="https://pathspider.net/">open source code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/must-go-faster">analysis</a>, as we use in the MAMI project) but a comparable set of targets against to run experiments.</p>
<p>For some time, the Alexa top million web domains list has acted as a 
de facto standard of this comparable set of targets, and we’ve used it 
ourselves in several studies.&nbsp;Recent announcements by Amazon have 
made it clear that the Alexa top million list will no longer be freely 
available, and the announced cost for API access have made periodic 
resolution of the list too expensive for most&nbsp;active measurement 
studies. Therefore, we have started compilation of a public targets list
 to replace this de-facto standard.</p>
<p>The initial MAMI Public Targets List is available in GitHub; see the <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/targets/blob/master/README.md">README</a> there for details.</p>

				<p>MAMI was represented by ETH Zürich at the 97th meeting of the Internet Engineering Task Force in Seoul.</p>

<p>The biggest news this time around&nbsp;was the first meeting of the 
QUIC working group, which will standardize a next-generation, encrypted 
transport protocol encapsulated in UDP based on Google’s QUIC and TLS 
version 1.3.&nbsp;Brian Trammell presented a concept for a 
transport-independent state machine for middleboxes at the meeting, to 
start the discussion about how QUIC’s wire image should interact with 
on-path devices, both present and future. While it’s not clear how much 
of the proposed transport protocol mechanism will be adopted into QUIC, 
discussion during and after the working group meeting has led to <a href="https://mami-project.github.io/draft-trammell-plus-statefulness">further refinement</a> thereof.</p>

<p>Mirja Kühlewind chaired a meeting of the Measurement and Analysis for
 Protocols Research Group (MAPRG), the first meeting since the group was
 officially chartered. The four presentations included techniques for 
passive delay measurements, a study&nbsp;of broadband access peformance 
using M-Lab, a study of the performance gain associated with HTTP2, and a
 characterization of traffic rate policing in the Internet.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-trammell-post-sockets">Post Sockets</a>, the API concept atop MAMI’s flexible transport layer (FTL), <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/97/slides/slides-97-taps-post-sockets-brian-trammel-eth-zurich-00.pdf">was discussed</a> at the TAPS working group meeting. Tommy Pauly of Apple, a co-author of the Post draft, presented a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/97/slides/slides-97-taps-moving-beyond-sockets-architecture-and-observations-tommy-pauly-apple-00.pdf">quite similar approach</a>.
 Post is very much a work in progress, but we’re happy to see broad 
interest in the concept, and look forward to developing it further with a
 broad group of collaborators both inside and outside the project.</p>

<p>The Bandwidth Aggregation for Networked Access (BANANA) BoF looked 
into standardizing approaches to share bandwidth on a customer network 
across two access links (usually one mobile and one terrestrial), as we 
explored in our <a href="https://irtf.org/anrw/2016/anrw16-final21.pdf">ANRW paper</a>
 last year. There is a lot of interest in doing work in this space, but 
not yet a lot of agreement as to what that work is yet; as is often the 
case, discussion continues on the mailing list. The MAMI project will 
also look into providing cooperative signaling for such approaches.</p>
<p>Yaron Sheffer <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/97/slides/slides-97-acme-short-term-certificates-yaron-00.pdf">presented a solution</a>
 to the problem addressed in last meeting’s LURK BoF using short-term, 
automatically renewable certificates provisioned using the ACME protocol
 to the ACME working group meeting. The draft has a good chance of being
 adopted in the timeframe of the next IETF meeting, and work is 
progressing in parallel on a prototype.</p>
<p>Mirja Kühlewind and Brian Trammell&nbsp;led a discussion on protocol 
transitions in transport protocols at the Transport Area’s open meeting,
 both as an open forum on transition in an area full of efforts to 
deploy new work at Internet scale, and as input for an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-iab-protocol-transitions">IAB document</a> on the topic.</p>
<p>We’re back in Zürich now, and the jet lag is finally over. We’re 
already busy preparing for&nbsp;IETF 98&nbsp;in March in Chicago, and 
the QUIC working group’s interim in Tokyo in January!</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>In today’s Internet we see an increasing deployment of 
middleboxes. While middleboxes provide in-network functionality that is 
necessary to keep networks manageable and economically viable, any 
packet mangling — whether essential for the needed functionality or 
accidental as an unwanted side effect — makes it more and more difficult
 to deploy new protocols or extensions of existing protocols.</p>
<p>For the evolution of the protocol stack, it is important to know 
which network impairments exist and potentially need to be worked 
around. While classical network measurement tools are often focused on 
absolute performance values, PATHspider performs A/B testing between two
 different protocols or different protocol extensions to perform 
controlled experiments of protocol-dependent connectivity problems as 
well as differential treatment.</p>
<p>PATHspider 1.0.1 has been released today and is now available from <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pathspider/tree/1.0.1">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pathspider/1.0.1">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/pathspider">Debian unstable</a>. This is a small stable update containing a documentation fix for the <a href="http://pathspider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugindev.html#example-plugin">example plugin</a>.</p>
<p>PATHspider now contains 3 built-in plugins for measuring path 
transparency to explicit congestion notification, DiffServ code points 
and TCP Fast Open. It’s easy to write your own plugins, and if they’re 
good enough, they may be included in the PATHspider distribution at the 
next feature release.</p>
<p>We have a <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/pathspider-example/">GitHub repository</a>
 you can fork that has a premade directory structure for new plugins. 
You’ll need to implement logic for performing the two connections, for 
the A and the B tests. Once you’ve verified your connection logic is 
working with Wireshark, you can move on to writing Observer functions to
 analyse the connections made in real time as PATHspider runs. The final
 step is to merge the results of the connection logic (e.g. did the 
operating system report a timeout?) with the results of your observer 
functions (e.g. was ECN successfully negotiated?) and write out the 
final result.</p>
<p>We have dedicated a <a href="http://pathspider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugindev.html">section of the manual</a>
 to the development of plugins and we really see plugins as first-class 
citizens in the PATHspider ecosystem. While future releases of 
PATHspider may contain new plugins, we’re also making it easier to write
 plugins by providing reusable library functions such as the 
tcp_connect() function of the SynchronisedSpider that allows for easy 
A/B testing of TCP connections with any globally configured state set. 
We also provide reusable observer functions for simple tasks such as 
determining if a 3-way handshake completed or if there was an ICMP 
unreachable message received.</p>

				<p>Tremendous effort is undergoing to make the Web faster. However, 
quantifying speed on the Web is complex: usually we are attempting to 
capture human perception with a computer-generated metric. In many 
studies, participants are simply shown a page loading, in person, in a 
controlled environment, which has a clear scalability problem. MAMI 
partners at Telefonica Research (in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon 
University) took a different approach and built <a href="https://eyeorg.net/" target="_blank">Eyeorg</a>,
 an automated system for crowdsourcing Web Quality of Experience (QoE) 
measurements. Eyeorg uses crowdsourced participants to scale and shows 
videos of pages loading to provide a consistent experience to all 
participants, regardless of their network connections and device 
configurations. In their <a href="https://eyeorg.net/eyeorg.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>,
 to be published at CONEXT 2016, they present hands-on experience from 
using Eyeorg to 1) study the quality of several PLT metrics, 2) compare 
HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 performance, and 3) assess the impact of online 
advertisements and ad blockers on user experience. A key result they 
observed is that many videos have two modes, one for participants who 
consider the pages “ready” when the primary content is in place and one 
for those who wait for auxiliary content like advertisement (see below).
 These results show the potential of Eyeorg to measure the impact 
changes to the web have on people. For example, Eyeorg can be used to 
evaluate TCP vs. QUIC, TLS 1.2 vs TLS 1.3, HTTP/2 push/priority 
strategies, web design techniques like domain sharding or image 
spriting, browser plugins, or even in-network services like Google’s 
Flywheel compression proxy.</p>

<p>The MAMI project was out in force at last week’s IETF 96 meeting in 
Berlin.&nbsp;The Measurement and Analysis for Protocols Research Group, 
founded by MAMI partner ETH and chaired by coordinator Mirja Kühlewind 
and external advisor Dave Plonka from Akamai, was officially chartered 
as a research group of the Internet Research Task Force during the 
meeting. MAPRG provides a place to discuss protocol-design-relevant 
measurement techniques and results. MAPRG’s Monday evening meeting 
included several interesting presentations on ongoing measurements, 
including an interesting CDN-based <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/96/slides/slides-96-maprg-1.pdf">survey</a> of active IPv4 space and dynamic address allocation policies by Phillip Richter.</p>
<p></p><div id="attachment_321" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-321 size-large" src="src/IMG_1772-1024x324.jpg" alt="IMG_1772" width="640" height="203"><p class="wp-caption-text">Full room at the QUIC BoF on Wednesday morning, IETF 96, Berlin</p></div><p></p>
<p>The biggest event on the IETF calendar this time was the <a href="http://recs.conf.meetecho.com/Playout/watch.jsp?recording=IETF96_QUIC&amp;chapter=chapter_1">QUIC</a>
 Birds of a Feather (BoF) session on Wednesday morning, where on the 
order of 400 participants — about&nbsp;a third of the attendees of the 
IETF as a whole —&nbsp;discussed the formation of a working group to 
standardize the QUIC UDP-based transport protocol for HTTP and HTTP-like
 applications developed by Google. It seems likely that a working group 
will be formed in the coming weeks. Brian Trammell of ETH co-chaired the
 BoF. MAMI’s measurements of UDP impairment in the Internet are relevant
 to the deployability of QUIC, and the project will participate in the 
development of the protocol on the background of this measurement.</p>
<p>Another BoF of interest was a second Limited Use of Remote Keys 
(LURK) BoF, which decided not to form a working group to handle key 
management and delegation within content delivery networks, but rather 
to solve the problem using short-lived certificates, perhaps provisioned
 using the ACME protocol.</p>
<p>The Transport Area Open Meeting on Monday saw a presentation by 
Volker Sypli of Germany’s telecom regulator BNetzA, representing the 
European association of telecom regulators BEREC, invited by MAMI 
project coordinator and Transport Area Director Mirja Kühlewind, to 
explain the BEREC network neutrality guidelines. The discussion was 
interesting and spirited. While MAMI is not concerned with network 
neutrality per se, path impairment and neutrality violations are 
related, and work on the Path Transparency Observatory may contribute to
 the development of measurement tools for network neutrality, as well.</p>
<p>At the Transport Services (TAPS) working group on Thursday, Brian Trammell presented <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/96/slides/slides-96-taps-2.pdf">Post Sockets</a>,
 a potential API for the MAMI flexible transport layer. Discussion 
following the presentation indicates some interest in defining next 
generation APIs for transport, and the project will follow up with 
interested collaborators.</p>

<p>Most important for the MAMI project as a whole, though, was the <a href="http://recs.conf.meetecho.com/Playout/watch.jsp?recording=IETF96_PLUS&amp;chapter=chapter_1">Path Layer UDP Substrate (PLUS)</a>
 BoF on Thursday morning, which discussed and aimed to form a working 
group to standardize explicit cooperation approaches over UDP, informed 
by MAMI’s Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (MCP) development. While more 
work will be needed before a working group can be formed, there was 
significant interest in the room in continuing work on the effort, and 
we received valuable feedback from the community with respect to the 
scope and use cases, the details of the protocol mechanisms, and the 
privacy characteristics of explicit cooperation approaches in general. A
 presentation&nbsp;detailing the abstract mechanisms of the present 
proposal&nbsp;can be seen <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/96/slides/slides-96-plus-1.pdf">here</a>.
 Internet-Drafts describing the PLUS proposal in more detail will appear
 in the coming weeks. Watch this space for an announcement!</p>

				<p>The MAMI project held its second technical plenary on July 13-15,
 2016, in Berlin. This time also members of the External Advisory Board 
(EAB) participated. Thanks for your time, fruitful discussions and very 
valuable input! Also special thanks Joe Hildebrand for providing meeting
 space in the Cisco openBerlin Innovation Center (as well as the free 
barista team building event..)!</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-306" src="src/openBerlin.png" alt="openBerlin.jpg" width="199" height="149"><img class="alignnone wp-image-307" src="src/group.jpg" alt="group" width="414" height="149"></p>
<p>We started on our first afternoon with an open discussion slot 
focusing on two main topics of the project: test specifications and 
Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (MCP) design. While the MAMI project is 
currently running a number of path transparency tests on the Internet, 
we decided to also provide a specifications of current and planned tests
 to enable external parties to run similar measurements on other 
testbeds. Stay tuned, we will provide further measurement results as 
well as the specs soon!</p>
<p>Just before the meeting, we released the first PATHspider version “<em>Phidippus audax</em>”
 (0.9.0). In case you wonder why PATHspider only has six legs, there is a
 sad story to tell which involves a compression middlebox…</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px;"><img class="alignnone wp-image-106" src="src/pathspider-text.png" alt="pathspider-text" width="112" height="137"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-323" src="src/pathspider-release.png" alt="pathspider-release.jpg" width="300" height="136"></p>
<p>After submitting our first technical deliverable <a href="wp-content/uploads/2015/10/d3.1.pdf">D3.1 on Use Cases and Requirements</a>
 for MCP, we now enter the actual protocol design phase. We discussed 
and agreed on the basic mechanisms for signaling from and to 
middleboxes, as also outlined at the PLUS BoF meeting at IETF96 in the 
following week (see slides <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/mami-berlin/wp3-pathlayer.pdf">here</a>).</p>
<p>Further, work package 2 on Middlebox Classification and Modelling 
started this month. This work will be informed by our own middlebox 
measurements and testing as well as additional tests we plan to run in 
cooperation with our EAB member Paul Hoffman on the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-maprg-1.pdf">ICANN middlebox testlab</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, we had a very productive and fruitful meeting, including 
an old-fashioned french dinner, and a great tour of craft breweries in 
bars throughout Berlin.</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
				<p>One of the primary goals of MAMI’s measurement work&nbsp;is to quantify&nbsp;<em>path transparency</em>
 in the Internet: how likely a given transport protocol or feature is to
 work on which paths, and how these features break. Earlier work by MAMI
 partners ETH and the University of Aberdeen on this topic focused on 
Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in TCP, a feature that allows 
congestion to be detected without packet loss. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-15509-8_15">Our paper</a>,
 based on measurements in August and September 2014 and published 
at&nbsp;PAM 2015, found that 56% of IPv4 and 65% of IPv6 hosts serving 
the Alexa top million websites would negotiate ECN if the client 
requested it, which at the time was not the default in any major client 
operating system. ECN negotiation attempts could&nbsp;lead to 
connectivity issues and&nbsp;fallback&nbsp;to non-ECN 
usage&nbsp;for&nbsp;0.42% of IPv4 and 0.05% of IPv6 servers in the top 
million.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Apple <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/94/slides/slides-94-hopsrg-7.pdf">has added</a> ECN negotiation by default on the client side in developer previews of Mac OS X and iOS, and <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/492135557dc090a1abb2cfbe1a412757e3ed68ab">our patch</a> adding fallback in the case of ECN failure to non-ECN usage, as specified in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/3168">RFC 3168</a>,&nbsp;has
 been added to the Linux kernel. The tooling for the 2015&nbsp;paper is 
evolving into a generic path impairment measurement tool called <a href="https://pathspider.net/">PathSpider</a>. So what’s the state of the Alexa top million today?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-285" src="src/ecn-trend-218x300.png" alt="ecn-trend" width="218" height="300">We recently ran a measurement from a single vantage point, a <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>
 server in Amsterdam, to the set of&nbsp;unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses 
serving the top million websites, and found that&nbsp;432544 of 617873 
(70.005%) of IPv4 addresses and&nbsp;20262 of 24472 (82.797%) IPv6 
addresses&nbsp;will negotiate ECN. This continues a trend ETH started 
observing in 2013, shown here.</p>
<p>The proportion of servers requiring fallback has not changed 
appreciably:&nbsp;0.44% of IPv4 and 0.11% of IPv6 servers. This reflects
 the two different forces at work: ECN support on the server side 
generally follows the operating system defaults, and web hosting 
machines generally run a recent Linux, the first operating system with 
server side ECN on by default. Connectivity problems, however, are often
 a function of faulty middleboxes, which are more slowly replaced, 
or&nbsp;firewall rules explicitly disabling ECN traffic for dubious 
reasons.</p>
<p>Detailed analysis behind this blog post is available <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/ecn-conspiracy/blob/master/2016/analysis.ipynb">here</a>; the raw data it runs on will be made available shortly.</p>

				<p>MAMI was represented at RIPE 72 in Copenhagen with two presentations by ETH. First, Mirja Kühlewind <a href="https://ripe72.ripe.net/archives/video/139">presented</a>
 a possible application of MAMI’s Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (MCP) 
in “What if we designed measurement as a first-order service?”, an 
exploration of what it would take to build Internet measurement on 
protocol foundations stronger than ping and a collection of ingenious 
hacks.</p>
<p>Brian Trammell also <a href="https://ripe72.ripe.net/archives/video/169">presented</a>
 “Internet Path Transparency Measurements using RIPE Atlas”, on MAMI’s 
use of the RIPE Atlas platform to find differential treatment between 
UDP and TCP, and the incidence of UDP blocking on access networks. Here,
 we found about 3% of Atlas probes to be on networks where UDP is 
severely impaired. More in-depth analysis of this question will appear 
in an upcoming paper, currently under submission.</p>

				<p>IETF95 was held last week (3-8 April) in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
 and the MAMI project was out in force. First and foremost, project 
coordinator Mirja Kühlewind assumed the office of IETF Transport Area 
Director at the plenary meeting on Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>Brian Trammell presented a <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-maprg-3.pdf">small research study</a>
 performed with RIPE Atlas at the Measurement and Analysis for Protocols
 (MAP) proposed Research Group, on the deployability of UDP 
encapsulation-based approaches to deploying new transport protocols, as 
MAMI will explore with its middlebox cooperation protocol (MCP) and 
flexible transport layer (FTL). He also presented <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/95/slides/slides-95-accord-1.pdf">a potential approach</a>
 to supporting low-latency service signaling using a new IP 
Differentiated&nbsp;Services codepoint at the “Alternatives to Content 
Classification for Operator Resource Deployment” (ACCORD) BoF, where 
explicit cooperation with respect to radio access network were 
discussed.</p>
<p>The Transport Services (TAPS) working group was interesting as well: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-taps-transports/">our&nbsp;abstract work</a>
 on decomposing transport protocols into features, to be published 
shortly, has led to the first concrete proposals on implementation.The 
NEAT project presented&nbsp;their proposed API for an adaptive transport
 layer, and MAMI will bring an&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/mami-project/roadshows/blob/master/post-sockets/post-sockets-intro.pdf">FTL API proposal</a> to the next meeting in Berlin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-274" src="src/CfM23fCUAAAsKQr-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></p>
<p>The Limited Use of Remote Keys (LURK) BoF was also of special 
interest to the project, as key management protocols useful in CDN and 
operator networks may present a way forward for cooperation with trusted
 middleboxes. MAMI partner TID is working on an <a href="https://github.com/mami-project/KeyServer">implementation</a> of a key server for LURK, and we’ll be watching continued developments in this space.</p>
<p>Being in Buenos Aires, the project made sure to enjoy the local cuisine (thanks Oscar Gonzalez for local arrangements!)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-270" src="src/IMG_1225-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_1225"  width="300" height="225"></p>
<p>And in the marketing department, MAMI’s measurement / experimentation / architecture stickers were a big hit.</p>

<p>We’re all back home and mostly recovered from the jet lag, but here 
are only three months left until the next IETF meeting in Berlin in 
July. We’ll be hard at work preparing, including a potential Birds of a 
Feather session to discuss the standardization of approaches like MAMI’s
 MCP. Watch this space!</p>

				<p>Over the last few weeks, we went around and gave a couple of 
presentations about the current and planned work in MAMI. Feedback was 
very positive and we identified more friendly people to work with. If 
you want to learn more about MAMI (illustrated with some nice and 
colorful picture), check out the slides on the <a href="index.php/papers/index.html">Publications</a> page. Especially the following presentations will provide you a good overview:</p>

				<p>The MAMI project held its first plenary meeting at the Networked Systems Group at ETH Zürich this week.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-254 size-large" src="src/IMG_1057-e1455185786490-1024x509.jpg" alt="IMG_1057" width="640" height="318"></p>
<p>The technical agenda included detailed discussions of measurement 
tool design, the beginnings of the detailed specification of our Path 
Transparency Observatory (as initially described in <a href="https://irtf.org/raim-2015-papers/raim-2015-paper12.pdf">our RAIM paper</a>), and further refinement of the use cases, requirements, and security model for our Middlebox Cooperation Protocol.</p>
<p>The nontechnical agenda included the obligatory-for-Switzerland-in-winter cheese fondue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-257" src="src/IMG_1058-300x213.jpg" alt="IMG_1058"  width="300" height="213"></p>
<p>We also began technical coordination with two related Horizon 2020 projects with whom we share partners:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.monroe-project.eu/">MONROE</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;a <a href="http://www.ict-fire.eu/">FIRE</a> testbed we’ll use for measurements as well as middlebox cooperation experiments, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.neat-project.org/">NEAT</a>&nbsp;aims
 to redesign application-transport interactions in the Internet. We look
 forward to a productive collaboration with both projects.</p>
<p>In addition, we formally appointed our External Advisory Board: Joe 
Hildebrand, Paul Hoffman, Dirk Kutscher, Allison Mankin, Szilveszter 
Nadas, and Dave Plonka. Welcome aboard, and many thanks to our advisors!</p>

				<p>Mirja Kühlewind (ETH) and Brian Trammell (ETH) from the MAMI project kicked off the new year by participating in a seminar at <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/">Schloss Dagstuhl</a> on <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=16012">Global Measurement Practice and Experience</a>.
 Dagstuhl seminars are always thought provoking, but in addition to 
informing the design of MAMI’s forthcoming Internet Path Transparency 
Observatory, two specific initiatives started there that we hope will 
ease the creation of measurement studies like the one we’re undertaking:
 first, a common platform&nbsp;for active measurement platforms on small
 hardware (e.g. Raspberry Pi); and second, a cooperative, 
Internet-measurement-focused “storage cloud” for reliable distribution 
of archival data generated by such platforms. Watch this space for 
future developments.</p>

				<p>MAMI (“Measurement and Architecture for a Middleboxed Internet”) 
is a European Commission Horizon 2020 funded research project. Our 
consortium is made up of seven European universities, research 
laboratories, and industrial partners. We aim to rearchitect the 
Internet to allow explicit cooperation between endpoints and 
middleboxes, restoring the promise and innovation potential of the 
original end-to-end architecture of the Internet while enabling 
appropriate in-network services to ease management and scalability of 
ever more demanding applications.</p>
<p>A central tussle in today’s Internet is that between the desire for 
privacy, which requires strong encryption to protect, and the need to 
efficiently manage network traffic. Current approaches to traffic 
management typically require access to plaintext and application 
payload, which is fundamentally incompatible with the privacy goal. By 
replacing implicit cooperation (e.g. middleboxes which assume they have 
access to traffic and understand its semantics) with explicit 
cooperation (endpoint and application signaling to middleboxes and 
vice-versa), we aim to break this tussle.</p>
<p>MAMI has two broad goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>empirical research to develop what kinds of middleboxes perform what
 kinds of manipulations on what paths, in order to understand the 
present Internet: both the extent and variety of&nbsp;in-network 
services&nbsp;as well as the degrees of freedom for incremental 
deployment of new protocols; and</li>
<li>development of a Middlebox Cooperation Protocol (MCP) that would 
enable explicit cooperation between endpoints and middleboxes, transport
 innovation, and ubiquitous encryption simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<p>MAMI will officially start in January 2016, but we’re already hard at work:</p>
<ul>
<li>the How Ossified is the Protocol Stack? (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/hopsrg/charter/">HOPS</a>)
 proposed research group within the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) 
met at IETF 92 in Prague and will meet again at IETF 93 in Yokohama; the
 RG provides a forum for exchanging information on measurements of 
middlebox impairment in the Internet and tools for researching it</li>
<li>A paper on an <a href="https://irtf.org/raim-2015-papers/raim-2015-paper12.pdf">initial proposal</a>
 for the MAMI Middlebox Observatory will be presented at the IRTF/ISOC 
workshop on Research and Applications of Internet Measurements (RAIM).</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep an eye on this blog for news about the project as we go forward.</p>
